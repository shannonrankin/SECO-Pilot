# Validate for Rails in Raven
1. Convert original selection files to Raven selection tables. 

```{r validate echo=FALSE include=FALSE}
#Identify the path to the file you want to modify
myBirdnetFile <- "E:/Rails/recordings/SGR-01/SGR-01_192b_20250602/birdnetLocal_SGR-01_192b_20250602/BirdNET_SelectionTable_SGR-01_192b_20250602.txt"

convert_birdnet_to_raven(
  infile = myBirdnetFile
)
```

2. Open in Raven
Open Raven Pro, then open all your sound files (page windows, 60 seconds). Once these have loaded, File --> Open Selection Table. Navigate to the selection table you just created (appended with "_raven"). Once the table has loaded, right-click on the table and choose 'Add Measurements', and then choose to add the preset 'rails'.
![Raven selection table measurements preset 'rails'.](/images/raven_table_preset_rails.jpg)

** If you manually validate, this would be the time to do it! I did not yet manually validate, so add this later**

Save selection table and close. Note that it takes a LONG time to save the selection table (~ 1hr) as it needs to run the analysis to get some of the measurements.
