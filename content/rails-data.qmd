The primary purpose of this pilot study was to collect preliminary data to determine the potential for passive acoustic monitoring to study Light-Footed Ridgeway's Rails (LFRR) in San Diego. This pilot study was conducted in two regions: The Tijuana Estuary and the LFRR Proving Pens at the Living Coast Discovery Center. All recordings were made using Audiomoth recorders with varying settings (more information on recording methods can be found [here](https://github.io/shannonrankin/SECO/methods-recorders)).

## Tijuana Estuary

Recorders were attached to a post situated near a small waterway at the Tijuana Estuary. This site was located near some Ridgeway's Rails (calls were heard during our deployment, as identified by Justyn Stahl).

## Living Coast Proving Pens

The Proving Pens at the Living Coast Discovery Center are used for breeding and raising young Ridgeway's Rails to support expanding the population of these endangered species. During this experiment, a breeding pair and their chicks were in Proving Pen #1 (SPP-1N), and a pair (no chicks) were in Proving Pen #3 (SPP-3S). Preliminary recordings provided high quality recordings within close proximity to known Ridgeway's Rails, proving voucher ('ground truth') data that can be used to improve automated detectors and validate the systems.

Additionally, we conducted an experiment to deploy recordings at distance from the two Proving Pens to obtain data to develop a detection function.
