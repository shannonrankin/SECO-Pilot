### Intro

-   [ ] Add Intro

### Methods- Intro

-   \[ \]

### Methods- Recorders

-   [ ] Create prelim list of recorders, pros/cons, and links to comparative studies

### Methods- Analysis

-   [ ] Bin Data (DRAFT COMPLETE)
-   [ ] Future: Need to validate recordings for specific species (Rails, at the least) and then calculate species-specific confidence thresholds using birdnetTools\<birdnet_calc_threshold.
-   [ ] Then, Create a **wetland_bird_detectionTable** of species detected and add confidence intervals, order by confidence interval (high to low), and highlight endangered species (Rails, etc)
-   [ ] Add Environmental Data (DRAFT complete for wind, rain... need to add temp?)

### Methods- Detection Function

-   [ ] create test dataframe (from real data) with these columns: Distance, SightingID, GroupSize (always 2?), see [these](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/duke-spatial-2015/practicals/1-detection-functions-solutions.html) examples
-   [ ] ds(

### Dashboard

### Data

-   [ ] Map to satellite image
-   [ ] Add all photos from phone to images folder on desktop, add photonames to deployDetails/Location_Site table

### QAQC

-   [ ] Review recordings to find TRUE start/end time, add that to deployDetails, then create code to modify start/end time in datasets.
-   [ ] Remove any detections before or after recording start/end date/time
-   [ ] Check data for numeric, all caps, all lowercase, and other consistent formatting.
-   [ ] Create a Lat/Long check
-   [ ] Find length of deployment w/in bounds, same for recording deployment
-   [ ] Check if battery or storage limited recording?
-   [ ] QAQC for truncated recording or bad files, create a check for each recorder/storage card to ID possible problem cards/recorders
-   [ ] confirm that each deployment_ID is unique, and that the components of the deployment_ID match the appropriate column info
-   [ ] If a new upload, check to see if any previous entries are different than the current ones (to ID possible accidental modifications in the ODS file). Create a log of these.
-   [ ] Create a log of all the QAQC outputs with the date, etc.
-   [ ] Check for updates to the other sheets in the ODS workbook
-   [ ] Check that all files have recording percursor (missing on SPP-DD10_48c_20250716)
-   [ ] Add precursor to those files that are missing it
-   [ ] Check start time for all files to ensure it is UTC and 'correct' (close to other deployments)
-   [ ] Check for missing data
-   [ ] Acoustic recording start/end: Using Raven, find official start/end, and add to SE_DeployDetails, also, ID number of bad files
-   \[ \]

### Sounds

-   [ ] Scrolling Spectrogram

-   [ ] Sample Sounds

### Results

-   [ ] DD: Map of locations for DD Pilot

-   [ ] DD: Table with SPP-1N, SPP-3S with distances to other recorders

-   [ ] DD: Prelim analysis with a few calls to do prelim detection function

-   [ ] DD: Warning note that further analysis is needed to fill out detection function, and that we need to do this for a wetland habitat (this is not typical habitat)

-   [ ] Link to Dashboard

-   [ ] Revise dielPlots to work for this data

### Dashboard

-   [ ] Value Boxes (Hrs Recording + Tb Data, \# Species Detected)
-   \[ \]

### Bibliography

### Biodiversity

### Bats

-   [ ] Review bat recordings to manually classify

-   [ ] Merge all detections for a recording

-   [ ] Modify *code/bat_kaleidoscope.r* file

    -   [ ] Remove any detections before or after recording start/end date/time

    -   [ ] Add columns for (1) Location, (2) Site

-   [ ] save as csv in github data folder

-   \[ \]
