## Data Prep

### Deployments

-   [ ] Data Checks (QAQC.r):

    -   [ ] Check that all files have recording percursor (missing on SPP-DD10_48c_20250716)

    -   [ ] Add precursor to those files that are missing it

    -   [ ] Check start time for all files to ensure it is UTC and 'correct' (close to other deployments)

    -   [ ] Check for missing data

    -   [ ] Acoustic recording start/end: Using Raven, find official start/end, and add to SE_DeployDetails, also, ID number of bad files

-   [ ] Update deployment spreadsheet and save primary sheet as a csv file to github/data

-   [ ] DeployDetails QAQC

    -   [ ] Create local Date/Time and create a date/time check for deploy/retrieve/start record/end recording

    -   [ ] Check data for numeric, all caps, all lowercase, and other consistent formatting.

    -   [ ] Create a Lat/Long check

    -   [ ] Find length of deployment w/in bounds, same for recording deployment

    -   [ ] Check if battery or storage limited recording?

    -   [ ] QAQC for truncated recording or bad files, create a check for each recorder/storage card to ID possible problem cards/recorders

    -   [ ] confirm that each deployment_ID is unique, and that the components of the deployment_ID match the appropriate column info

    -   [ ] If a new upload, check to see if any previous entries are different than the current ones (to ID possible accidental modifications in the ODS file). Create a log of these.

    -   [ ] Create a log of all the QAQC outputs with the date, etc.

    -   [ ] Check for updates to the other sheets in the ODS workbook

    -   \[ \]

-   [ ] Add all photos from phone to images folder on desktop, add photonames to deployDetails/Location_Site table

### Birds

For each recording:

-   [ ] Rename BirdNET_SelectionTable.txt to append and add name of folder (deploymentName)

-   [ ] Save BirdNET_SelectionTable_deploymentName.txt to SECO-Pilot/data folder in Github Repo

-   [ ] Data Prep using *bird_birdnet.r* file

    -   [ ] library(birdnetTools)

    -   [ ] merge all BirdNet_SelectionTable_xxx.txt files and save as BirdNet_SelectionTables_ALL.csv **birdnet_combine( )**

    -   [ ] UTC vs Local Time/Date **birdnet_add_datetime( )**

    -   [ ] Calculate species specific confidence thresholds for BirdNet detections **birdnet_calc_threshold( )**

    -   [ ] Code Name vs Scientific Name vs Common Name \[birdnetR/labels\]

    -   [ ] Add Location, Site

    -   [ ] Remove any detections before or after recording start/end date/time

    -   [ ] Save as a csv in SECO-Pilot/data folder

-   [ ] Data Analysis

    -   [ ] Create a **wetland_bird_detectionTable** of species detected and add confidence intervals, order by confidence interval (high to low), and highlight endangered species (Rails, etc)

    -   \[ \]

-   \[ \]

### Bats

-   [ ] Review bat recordings to manually classify

-   [ ] Merge all detections for a recording

-   [ ] Modify *code/bat_kaleidoscope.r* file

    -   [ ] Remove any detections before or after recording start/end date/time

    -   [ ] Add columns for (1) Location, (2) Site

-   [ ] save as csv in github data folder

-   \[ \]
