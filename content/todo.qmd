## Next

### NEXT!!

-   **Diurnal variation (rails-summary.qmd/DiurnalVariation)**

    -   May 27, SD 9am-2pm, UTC 2am to 7am

    -   Change range for TJE so we get more resolution

    -   Why are TJE detections only at night?

    -   Need to manually review that data to see what is up. Also, need to confirm timing on the device– peaks match SPP, but something is very wrong there.

-   


### *High Priority*

-   plotDetectionBoxPlot- need to overlay with effort (to improve understanding of quiet times)

-   Dashboard

    -   Fix Rails, Biodiversity components

        -   Side by Side formatting issues

    -   Value Box Size Issues

    -   User Defined?

-   Detection Distance

    -   Create a simulation

    -   Detection Function: create test dataframe (from real data) with these columns: Distance, SightingID, GroupSize (always 2?), see [these](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/duke-spatial-2015/practicals/1-detection-functions-solutions.html) examples

-   Scrolling Spectrograms (youtube)

    -   Check LFRR to see if it works with ojs

    -   If so, review data to identify other good recordings. Include: osprey, helicopter, insects, bats

    -   Sample sounds –\> youtube or other –\> spectrogram videos–\> sample sound video selections

-   Analysis: For each species, sort by confidence score (high to low) and review manually to determine species-specific confidence scores (see <https://connormwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wood-kahl-2024-guidelines-for-birdnet-scores.pdf)>

-   QAQC

    -   Check if battery or storage limited recording?

    -   QAQC for truncated recording or bad files, create a check for each recorder/storage card to ID possible problem cards/recorders

    -   Check why some recorders start recording time is next day?

    -   ID \# bad files

### *Lower Priority*

-   Insects

-   Bats

-   Acoustic Indices

    -   Run analyses and test (make sure they work)

    -   Save figure output to Biodiversity page

    -   Look at comparison between results

-   Soundscape

-   Comments

    -   Recorders- Create prelim list of recorders, pros/cons, and links to comparative studies. Possibly put this in recommendations or in separate section re: recorders?

    -   Analysis: Future: Need to validate recordings for specific species (Rails, at the least) and then calculate species-specific confidence thresholds using birdnetTools\<birdnet_calc_threshold.

        -   Analysis: Then, Create a **wetland_bird_detectionTable** of species detected and add confidence intervals, order by confidence interval (high to low), and highlight endangered species (Rails, etc)

    -   **Birdnet:** Ideally would run Perch, or at least run Birdnet from R/Python. Note in the reporting that this is recommended in the future to ensure standardization/consistency. (use birdnetR)

## Left Undone

-   [ ] Model Birdnet Performance Evaluation:
    -   [ ] Plot confidence scores (x) vs Frequency (n, on y axis)
    -   [ ] Random selection of clips from different confidence intervals
    -   [ ] Use Raven Review mode to review clips
-   [ ] Manual Review to assess classifier
    -   [ ] Review subset of data, determine if detection was true or false
    -   [ ] Create a plot of all manually reviewed detections where x axis is the confidence scores (from birdnet) and Y is Correct (true positives) or Wrong (false positives).
    -   [ ] What is the best threshold? Assess Precision & Recall and decide what is best for our study case.
    -   [ ] OR, model true detection as a function of model scores. (Do this above).
-   [ ] Detection Review
    -   [ ] DD: measures incl. amplitude for all calls
    -   [ ] Eliminate false positives
    -   [ ] Identify false negatives
    -   [ ] Label Noise?
-   [ ] Raw Data
    -   [ ] Organize Photos/label
    -   [ ] SCI data
