The primary purpose of this pilot study was to collect preliminary data to determine the potential for passive acoustic monitoring to study Ridgway's Rails in San Diego. This pilot study was conducted in two regions: The Tijuana Estuary and the Proving Pens at the Living Coast Discovery Center. All recordings were made using Audiomoth recorders with varying settings (Recording Methods can be found [here](https://github.io/shannonrankin/SECO/methods-recorders)).

## Tijuana Estuary

Recorders were attached to a post situated near a small waterway at the Tijuana Estuary. This site was located near some Ridgway's Rails (calls were heard during our deployment, as identified by Justyn Stahl, Jeff Crooks, and Aiyana Reissman).

## Living Coast Proving Pens

The Proving Pens at the Living Coast Discovery Center are used for breeding and raising young Ridgway's Rails to support expanding the population of these endangered species. During this experiment, a breeding pair and their chicks were in Proving Pen #1 (SPP-1N), and a pair (no chicks) were in Proving Pen #3 (SPP-3S). Preliminary recordings provided high quality recordings within close proximity to known Ridgway's Rails, proving voucher ('ground truth') data that can be used to improve automated detectors and validate the systems.

Additionally, we conducted an experiment to deploy recorders at distance from these known sound sources to develop a preliminary detection function to inform future survey designs.
