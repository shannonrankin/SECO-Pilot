	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring ({PAM}), particularly autonomous platforms, offers many advantages in monitoring phonating deep-diving marine mammals in oceanic environment. Relevant data can be obtained day and night continuously over long durations and in any weather conditions. It provides a cost-efficient solution with greater detection ranges when compared to traditional large research vessel and aerial visual surveys requiring keeping expert observers on station for long periods of time and relying on good visibility and calm seas. Therefore, {PAM} is becoming a preferred tool to assess population dynamics trends and health of deep-water marine mammal stocks. However the large volumes of collected data require robust automatic detection and classification algorithms to identify marine mammals in recordings. As for beaked whales, one of the challenging automatic processing goals is the identification of different species to advance our understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem. At present, traditional detection and classification methods employ searches for acoustic events above a user-defined signal-to-noise ratio threshold in the frequency band of interest and further rely on an experienced operator's manual inspection for species classification and removal of false positives. Current passive monitoring data collection systems yield large volumes of acoustic data, therefore a manual classification approach becomes very time-consuming and impractical. This paper focuses on developing a multi-stage automatic classifier for beaked whale species. The proposed method utilizes unsupervised machine clustering of signal attributes extracted from potential detection events flagged by an energy-band detector. The proposed algorithm was benchmarked against a manually annotated workshop dataset and applied to acoustic data collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The algorithm classifies beaked whale species in automatic mode with minimal operator involvement only at the validation stage. When compared with the manually annotated classification dataset, the proposed method achieved a recall rate of 82.8\% for Cuvier's and 77.9\% for Gervais' species in automatic mode. New insights on habitat use by different species of beaked whales in the Gulf of Mexico were gained when using the species-specific classifier. The high spatial resolution acoustic monitoring results showed that the habitat preferences of two dominating beaked whale species in the Gulf of Mexico support the habitat division (ecological niche) hypothesis.},

	abstract = {A novel framework for acoustic detection and species identification is proposed to aid passive acoustic monitoring studies on the endangered Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) in South African waters. Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) were used for both detection and identification of dolphin vocalisations tasks, and performance was evaluated using custom and pre-trained architectures (transfer learning). In total, 723 min of acoustic data were annotated for the presence of whistles, burst pulses and echolocation clicks produced by Delphinus delphis ({\textasciitilde}45.6\%), Tursiops aduncus ({\textasciitilde}39\%), Sousa plumbea ({\textasciitilde}14.4\%), Orcinus orca ({\textasciitilde}1\%). The best performing models for detecting dolphin presence and species identification used segments (spectral windows) of two second lengths and were trained using images with 70 and 90 dpi, respectively. The best detection model was built using a customised architecture and achieved an accuracy of 84.4\% for all dolphin vocalisations on the test set, and 89.5\% for vocalisations with a high signal to noise ratio. The best identification model was also built using the customised architecture and correctly identified S. plumbea (96.9\%), T. aduncus (100\%), and D. delphis (78\%) encounters in the testing dataset. The developed framework was designed based on the knowledge of complex dolphin sounds and it may assists in finding suitable {CNN} hyper-parameters for other species or populations. Our study contributes towards the development of an open-source tool to assist long-term studies of endangered species, living in highly diverse habitats, using passive acoustic monitoring.},

A method for the passive monitoring of diversity, activity and acoustic phenology of structural species of a bird community in an annual cycle is presented. The method includes the semi-automatic elaboration of a dataset of 22 vocal and instrumental forms of 16 species. To analyze bioacoustic richness, the {UMAP} algorithm was run on two parallel feature extraction channels. A convolutional neural network was trained using {STFT}-Mel spectrograms to perform the task of automatic identification of bird species. The predictive performance was evaluated by obtaining a minimum average precision of 0.79, a maximum equal to 1.0 and a {mAP} equal to 0.97. The model was applied to a huge set of passive recordings made in a network of urban wetlands for one year. The acoustic activity results were synchronized with climatological temperature data and sunlight hours. The results confirm that the proposed method allows for monitoring a taxonomically diverse group of birds that nourish the annual soundscape of an ecosystem, as well as detecting the presence of cryptic species that often go unnoticed.},

Acoustic monitoring is an efficient non-invasive method, which may be deployed for surveys of animals as diverse as insects, birds, and bats. Long-term unmanned automatic monitoring may provide unique unbiased data from a whole season, but the large amount of data presents serious challenges for the automatic processing of the measurements. To demonstrate feasibility of automatic multi-channel surveying using a new prototype hardware, we carried out a 2-month study of echolocating bats requiring high data sampling rates (500kHz). Using a sound energy threshold criterion for triggering recording, we collected 236GB (Gi=10243) of data at full bandwidth. We implemented a simple automatic method using a Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) classifier based on a combination of temporal and spectral analyses to classify events into bat calls and non-bat events. After experimentation we selected duration, energy, bandwidth, and entropy as classification features to identify short high energy structured sounds in the right frequency range. The spectral entropy makes use of the orderly arrangement of frequencies in bat calls to reject short noise pulses, e.g. from rain. The {SVM} classifier reduced our dataset to 162MB of candidate bat calls with an estimated accuracy of 96\% for dry nights and 70\% when it was raining. The automatic survey revealed calls from two species of bat not previously recorded in the area, as well as an unexpected abundance of social calls. The recordings provide data which can be used to correlate bat activity with rain, temperature, and sunset/sunrise. We discuss future applications, achieving higher accuracy in classifying bat calls and the possibility of using trajectory-tracking data to determine bat behavior and correct for the bias toward loud bats inherent in acoustic surveying.},

	abstract = {Automatic detection and classification of animal sounds has many applications in biodiversity monitoring and animal behavior. In the past twenty years, the volume of digitised wildlife sound available has massively increased, and automatic classification through deep learning now shows strong results. However, bioacoustics is not a single task but a vast range of small-scale tasks (such as individual {ID}, call type, emotional indication) with wide variety in data characteristics, and most bioacoustic tasks do not come with strongly-labelled training data. The standard paradigm of supervised learning, focussed on a single large-scale dataset and/or a generic pre-trained algorithm, is insufficient. In this work we recast bioacoustic sound event detection within the {AI} framework of few-shot learning. We adapt this framework to sound event detection, such that a system can be given the annotated start/end times of as few as 5 events, and can then detect events in long-duration audio—even when the sound category was not known at the time of algorithm training. We introduce a collection of open datasets designed to strongly test a system's ability to perform few-shot sound event detections, and we present the results of a public contest to address the task. Our analysis shows that prototypical networks are a very common used strategy and they perform well when enhanced with adaptations for general characteristics of animal sounds. However, systems with high time resolution capabilities perform the best in this challenge. We demonstrate that widely-varying sound event durations are an important factor in performance, as well as non-stationarity, i.e. gradual changes in conditions throughout the duration of a recording. For fine-grained bioacoustic recognition tasks without massive annotated training data, our analysis demonstrate that few-shot sound event detection is a powerful new method, strongly outperforming traditional signal-processing detection methods in the fully automated scenario.},

The faunal vocalisations captured by these sensors can answer ecological questions, however, identifying these vocalisations within recorded audio is difficult: automatic recognition is currently intractable and manual recognition is slow and error prone. In this paper, a semi-automated approach to call recognition is presented. An automated decision support tool is tested that assists users in the manual annotation process. The respective strengths of human and computer analysis are used to complement one another. The tool recommends the species of an unknown vocalisation and thereby minimises the need for the memorization of a large corpus of vocalisations. In the case of a folksonomic tagging system, recommending species tags also minimises the proliferation of redundant tag categories. We describe two algorithms: (1) a “naïve” decision support tool (16\%–64\% sensitivity) with efficiency of O(n) but which becomes unscalable as more data is added and (2) a scalable alternative with 48\% sensitivity and an efficiency {ofO}(logn). The improved algorithm was also tested in a {HTML}-based annotation prototype. The result of this work is a decision support tool for annotating faunal acoustic events that may be utilised by other bioacoustics projects.},

In this context, the present paper addresses how the traditional computation of spectrograms and Sound Pressure Levels ({SPL}) could be used for analyzing large sound datasets. Additionally, a visualization tool named here as {SPL}-Gram and a method for automatic detection of trends in dawn and dusk choruses are presented. The dataset used as a case study represents 3months of underwater sound collected in a marine wildlife refuge in southern Brazilian coast. Results reveal events with strong daily periodicity, originated by fish choruses in the frequency band from 0.01–2kHz, and, in the higher frequencies, reflecting acoustic activity of crustaceans. The reported periodicities show a marked relation with sunrise and sunset through the studied period, thus revealing circadian cycles present in the monitored environment. The proposed methodology is not only easy for implementation, but also proves to be valuable in the description of daily and seasonal patterns of biological choruses in large acoustic datasets.},

	abstract = {Long duration acoustic monitoring is becoming an increasingly popular approach to extend survey effort by using autonomous sensors to passively collect data over large temporal and spatial scales. This is of particular benefit when attempting to detect a species whose temporal vocalization strategy is unknown, and whose small population size reduces detection probability. It is also of benefit in environments that are logistically difficult to access such as wetlands. We investigated the vocalization strategy of the Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), a species of high conservation concern in the Western hemisphere and ‘in need of management’ in multiple states of the {USA}. The Least Bittern is a secretive marsh bird that is primarily detected by its vocalizations and call-playback surveys are typically used for population monitoring. To minimize disturbance to both the birds and their habitat, we deployed autonomous acoustic recording units and collected continuous 24-hour audio recordings for 30 days. The resultant accumulation of data necessitated an automated method to assist with analysis and interpretation. We successfully applied a novel soundscape technique—long-duration, false-color ({LDFC}) spectrograms—to visually confirm presence of Least Bittern from the ‘coo coo coo’ vocalization associated with breeding. In addition, we used a machine learning technique to automate the acoustic event detection process. Peak vocalization times were then predicted from an annotated dataset of actual calls and subsequently used to develop an optimal acoustic survey strategy. The results of this research demonstrate how machine learning methods can search large data sets for a specific species. This information can then be used to optimize existing monitoring methods, to increase detection probability and to minimize associated costs.},

This approach allows us to follow up changes in population density and to define breeding sites in a changing environment. We present the results of five years of continuous acoustic monitoring of Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris) in a recent wetland restoration area. Using a setup consisting of four four-channel recorders equipped with cardioid microphones we recorded vocal activity during entire nights. Vocalizations of bitterns were detected on the recordings by spectrogram template matching. On basis of time differences of arrival ({TDOA}) of the acoustic signals at different recording devices booming bitterns could be mapped using hyperbolic localization. During the study period not only changes in the number of calling birds but also changes in their spatial distribution connected with changes in habitat structure could be documented. This semi-automated approach towards monitoring birds described here could be applied to a wide range of monitoring tasks for animals with long distance vocalizations.},

	abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks ({DNNs}) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a {DNN}, called {BirdNET}, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks ({ResNets}), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four {eBird} hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short {FFT} window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, {BirdNET} achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, {BirdNET} and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.},

	abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks ({DNNs}) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a {DNN}, called {BirdNET}, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks ({ResNets}), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four {eBird} hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short {FFT} window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, {BirdNET} achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, {BirdNET} and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.},

This manuscript presents a method for rapidly analyzing the results of band-limited energy detectors, which are commonly used for the detection of passerine nocturnal flight calls, but which typically are beset by high false positive rates. We first manually classify a subset of the detected events as signals of interest or false detections. From that subset, we build a Random Forest model to eliminate most of the remaining events as false detections without further human inspection. The overall reduction in the labor required to separate signals of interest from false detections can be 80\% or more. Additionally, we present an R package, flightcallr, containing functions which can be used to implement this new workflow.},

	abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly using bioacoustics in wildlife monitoring programs. Remote autonomous sound recorders provide new options for collecting data for species and in contexts that were previously difficult. However, post-processing of sound files to extract relevant data remains a significant challenge. Detection algorithms, or call recognizers, can aid automation of species detection but their performance and reliability has been mixed. Further, building recognizers typically requires either costly commercial software or expert programming skills, both of which reduces their accessibility to ecologists responsible for monitoring. In this study we investigated the performance of open-source call recognizers provided by the {monitoR} package in R, a language popular among ecologists. We tested recognizers on sound data collected under natural conditions at nests of two endangered subspecies of black-cockatoo, the Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus (n = 23 nests), and the south-eastern red-tailed black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne (n = 20 nests). Specifically, we tested the performance of binary point matching recognizers in confirming daily nest activity (active or inactive) and nesting outcome (fledge or fail). We tested recognizers on recordings from nests of known status using 3 × 3-h recordings per nest, from early, mid and late stages of the recording period. Daily nest activity was correctly assigned in 61.7\% of survey days analysed (n = 60 days) for the red-tailed black-cockatoo, and 62.3\% of survey days (n = 69 days) for the glossy black-cockatoo. Fledging was successfully detected in all cases. Precision (true positive / true positive + false positive) of individual detections was 70.2\% for the south-eastern red-tailed black-cockatoo and 37.1\% for the Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo. Manual verification of outputs is still required, but it is not necessary to verify all detections to confirm an active nest (i.e., nest is deemed active when true positives are identified). We conclude that bioacoustics combined with semi-automated post-processing can be an appropriate tool for nest monitoring in these endangered subspecies.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is increasingly being used for studying marine mammals, leading to the accumulation of large acoustic datasets. Analyzing these datasets becomes impractical without automated detection and classification software. Detectors and classifiers based on deep neural networks have shown great potential, but their performance is often limited by the availability of sufficient quantities of annotated training samples, and their application restricted to the specific acoustic environment(s) from which their training data were collected. We address these limitations by employing transfer learning, a deep learning concept whereby knowledge from a source domain is transferred to a target domain. Specifically, we considered two different underwater acoustic environments as the source and target domains. The objective was to use a deep neural network that had been trained in one environment with abundant annotated training samples, and optimize its performance in the other environment where the annotated training samples were limited. Training and testing were conducted using three acoustic datasets containing North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls. Experiments show that adapting a trained model to the new environment led to a substantial improvement in recall from 70\% to 85\%, while maintaining a low false-positive rate of less than 5 per hour. The methodology is implemented as an open-source Python tool to facilitate the creation of more tailored deep learning-based acoustic detectors and classifiers for North Atlantic right whale vocalizations and other stereotyped marine mammal calls.},

The impact of different parameters on the data and applicability of the data to the specific questions being asked should be considered before deployment. Here we explore the effect of recording and detection parameters on marine mammal acoustic data across two platforms. Daily classifications of marine mammal vocalizations from two passive acoustic monitors with different subsampling parameters, an {AURAL} and a Passive Aquatic Listener ({PAL}), collocated in the Bering Sea were compared. The {AURAL} subsampled on a pre-set schedule, whereas the {PAL} sampled via an adaptive protocol. Detected signals of interest were manually classified in each dataset independently. The daily classification rates of vocalizations were similar. Detections from the higher duty-cycle but lower sample rate {AURAL} were limited to species and vocalizations with energy below 4kHz precluding detection of echolocation signals. Temporal coverage from the {PAL} audio files was limited by the adaptive sub-sampling protocol. A method for classifying ribbon (Histriophoca fasciata) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) vocalizations from the sparse spectral time histories of the {PAL} was developed. Although application of the acoustic entropy as a rapid assessment of biodiversity was not reflective of the number of species detected, acoustic entropy was robust to changes in sample rate and window length.},

Acoustic monitoring has advantages over traditional visual surveys including greater detection ranges, continuous long-term monitoring in remote locations under various weather conditions and independent of daylight, and lower cost. However, until recently, the technology required to autonomously record whale sounds over long durations has been limited to low-frequency ({\textless} 1000 Hz) baleen whales. The need for a broader-band, higher-data capacity system capable of autonomously recording toothed whales and other marine mammals for long periods has prompted the development of a High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package ({HARP}) capable of sample rates up to 200 {kHz}. Currently, {HARPs} accumulate data at a rate of almost 2 {TB} per instrument deployment which creates challenges for processing these large data sets. One method we employ to address some of these challenges is a spectral averaging algorithm in which the data are compressed and viewed as long duration spectrograms. These spectrograms provide the ability to view large amounts of data quickly for events of interest, and they provide a link for quickly accessing the short time-scale data for more detailed analysis. {HARPs} are currently in use worldwide to acoustically monitor marine mammals for behavioral and ecological long-term studies. The {HARP} design is described and data analysis strategies along with software tools are discussed using examples of broad-band recorded data.},

	abstract = {Submarine canyons are key structures for ecosystem functioning in the Mediterranean Sea. This study was conducted in the canyon of Calvi (North-West Corsica, France) by using a combination of Static Acoustic Monitoring ({SAM}) and hydrophone integrated gliders (Seaexplorer, Alseamar). During summer 2016 and 2017, three {SAM} campaigns (-125 m to -150 m, 3 kilometers from coastline) and one gliders mission (-900 m to -60 m, 6 kilometers to 3 kilometers from coastline) were here conducted. A total of 194 hours of recordings were analysed for fish sound diversity (i.e. number of sound types) and for fish sound abundance (number of sounds per sound type and per unit of time). 
 
Biological sounds were detected in 37\% of the recorded audio files. Besides for the presence of marine mammals clicks and whistles, at least 9 sound types (for a total of more than 8.000 sounds) with characteristics similar to those emitted by known vocal fish species were characterised; for one of these, emitter identity could be inferred at the genus level (Ophidion sp.). Furthermore, an increase in Sea Ambient Noise between 10 and 15 {dB} re 1 µPa was observed during daytime hours due to boat traffic. 
 
The vastness of the deep-sea and, in particular, the heterogeneity of submarine canyons, their high biodiversity and level of fauna specificity, together with the very localized character of observations carried out to date fully justify the use of an holistic monitoring approach such as {PAM}, especially when a combination of methods is used (e.g. {SAM} and gliders). Our study demonstrate that {PAM} can provide novel information about the ecoacoustics and the distribution of vocal fish species in these pivotal Mediterranean environments and can assess the contribution of anthropogenic sound and their adverse effects (such as masking) on fishes.},

Three empirical approaches (trial-based, distance-sampling, and spatially explicit capture-recapture) are used to estimate the probability of detecting the echolocation pulses as a function of range. These detection functions are used with two point-transect methods (snapshot and dive-cue) to estimate density. Measurement errors result in a small range of density estimates (3.9–5.4 whales per 1000 km2). Use of multiple approaches and methods allows comparison of the required information and assumptions of each. The distance-sampling approach with snapshot-based density estimates has the most stringent assumptions but would be the easiest to implement for large scale surveys of beaked whale density. Alternative approaches to estimating detection functions help validate this approach. The dive cue method of density estimation has promise, but additional work is needed to understand the potential bias caused by animal movement during a dive. Empirical methods are a viable alternative to the theoretical acoustic modeling approaches that have been used previously to estimate beaked whale density.},

Data were collected during a shipboard survey in the western North Atlantic Ocean using a towed linear hydrophone array. Beaked whale tracks were classified as either Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) or Gervais'/True's (Mesoplodon europaeus/Mesoplodon mirus). Weighted species average depths and weighted species standard deviations were 1158 m ± 287 m for Cuvier's (n = 24), and 870 m ± 151 m for Gervais'/True's (n = 15). Depth uncertainties ranged from 3\% to 142\% of the average depth. Slant ranges were corrected for depth to provide average horizontal perpendicular distance estimates. The average horizontal perpendicular distance distribution exhibited fewer detections in the first bin than the second.

	abstract = {During the 2017 Hawaiian Islands Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey ({HICEAS}), 19 drifting hydrophone recorders were deployed around the main Hawaiian Islands with the goal of improving detection of beaked whales and Kogia. These Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders ({DASBRs}) contained a two-element vertical hydrophone array at 150 m depth, sampling at 288 {kHz} for 2 of every 10 min. Deployment locations were planned to cover a 50 nmi minimum convex polygon around the main Hawaiian Islands ({MHI} Stratum). In actuality, {DASBRs} drifted significantly within the {MHI} Stratum and up to 200 nmi beyond. Overall, the {DASBRs} collected data over a 96-day period and over 6,354 km of drifting track. Using the Click Detector Module within {PAMGuard} (version 2.00.11), cetacean echolocation pulses within 2-min periods were classified to species based on peak frequency and other pulse characteristics. We found frequency modulated ({FM}) pulses characteristic of Longman’s, Cuvier’s, Blainville’s, and Cross Seamount beaked whales ({BWC}) in 928 of the 2-min files, spread along the drift track of each {DASBR}. Additionally, two types of Kogia spp. echolocation clicks were detected with peak frequencies of 116 {kHz} and 123 {kHz}. To further improve detections of Kogia spp. echolocation clicks, custom {MATLAB} subroutines were used to re-analyze the recordings in greater detail resulting in 60 2-min detections versus the original 13 detected with these {PAMGuard} classifiers. Detections of sperm whales (in 2,809 2-min files) and echolocation from unidentified odontocetes (in 3,939 2-min files) were also identified. Acoustic detections of beaked whales and Kogia spp. were much more numerous than those from the towed array efforts during {HICEAS} 2017 and will enhance understanding of the distribution of these species in the main Hawaiian Islands.},

A suite of routines designed to efficiently detect cetacean sounds, extract features, and classify the detection to species is described using ship-based, visually verified detections of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens). The best-performing model included features from clicks, whistles, and burst pulses, which correctly classified 99.6\% of events. This case study illustrates use of these tools to build classifiers for any group of cetacean species and assess classification confidence when visual confirmation is not available.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Direct comparisons to fixed recorders are necessary to evaluate these tools as passive acoustic monitoring platforms. One glider and two drifting deep-water floats were simultaneously deployed within a deep-water cabled hydrophone array to quantitatively assess their survey capabilities. The glider was able to follow a pre-defined track while float movement was somewhat unpredictable. Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) 20 Hz pulses were recorded by all hydrophones throughout the two-week deployment. Calls were identified using a template detector, which performed similarly across recorder types. The glider data contained up to 78\% fewer detections per hour due to increased low-frequency flow noise present during glider descents. The glider performed comparably to the floats and fixed recorders at coarser temporal scales; hourly and daily presence of detections did not vary by recorder type. Flow noise was related to glider speed through water and dive state. Glider speeds through water of 25 cm/s or less are suggested to minimize flow noise and the importance of glider ballasting, detector characterization, and normalization by effort when interpreting glider-collected data and applying it to marine mammal density estimation are discussed.},

	abstract = {High-resolution monitoring is fundamental to understand ecosystems dynamics in an era of global change and biodiversity declines. While real-time and automated monitoring of abiotic components has been possible for some time, monitoring biotic components—for example, individual behaviours and traits, and species abundance and distribution—is far more challenging. Recent technological advancements offer potential solutions to achieve this through: (i) increasingly affordable high-throughput recording hardware, which can collect rich multidimensional data, and (ii) increasingly accessible artificial intelligence approaches, which can extract ecological knowledge from large datasets. However, automating the monitoring of facets of ecological communities via such technologies has primarily been achieved at low spatiotemporal resolutions within limited steps of the monitoring workflow. Here, we review existing technologies for data recording and processing that enable automated monitoring of ecological communities. We then present novel frameworks that combine such technologies, forming fully automated pipelines to detect, track, classify and count multiple species, and record behavioural and morphological traits, at resolutions which have previously been impossible to achieve. Based on these rapidly developing technologies, we illustrate a solution to one of the greatest challenges in ecology: the ability to rapidly generate high-resolution, multidimensional and standardised data across complex ecologies.},

Focusing on the comparison of underwater gliders and propeller-driven {AUVs}, a simple glide metric is presented and the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders Slocum, Spray and Seaglider as well as propeller-modified versions thereof is evaluated. The evaluation is based on various data sets from wind tunnel tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) studies, and shows that for the respective hull shapes gliding locomotion proves more efficient in ideal conditions. However, biofouling conditions inflict a double penalty on glider performance, rendering gliders inferior to propeller-driven vehicles. The Slocum data set is used to validate a steady-state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance prediction. It is shown that even simplistic models based on semi-empirical and analytical expressions can be successfully used for design optimization through parametrization. Being computationally efficient, the model can be a useful tool for design engineers in early design phases. The model is used to evaluate the effects of wing span on gliding efficiency, indicating that the current design of the Slocum glider is near-optimal.},

	abstract = {Mitigating the effects of human activities on marine mammals often depends on monitoring animal occurrence over long time scales, large spatial scales, and in real time. Passive acoustics, particularly from autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify, and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two 3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to compare results between three different analysts to determine repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0\% for all species. Daily missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24\%. Agreement between two trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95\% for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83–89\% for humpback whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species. Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.},

As a reference, a hydrophone array was deployed alongside the glider and buoy at a shallow-water site southwest of Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts, {USA}) over a four-week period in spring 2017. A call-by-call comparison between North Atlantic right whale upcalls localized with the array (n = 541) and those detected by the glider or buoy was used to estimate the detection function for each {DMON}/{LFDCS} platform. The probability of detection was influenced by range, ambient noise level, platform depth, detection process, review protocol, and calling rate. The conservative analysis of near real-time pitch tracks suggested that, under typical conditions, a 0.33 probability of detection of a single call occurred at 6.2 km for the buoy and 8.6–13.4 km for the glider (depending on glider depth), while a 0.10 probability of detection of a single call occurred at 14.4 m for the buoy and 22.6–27.5 km for the glider. Probability of detection is predicted to increase substantially at all ranges if more than one call is available for detection.},

	abstract = {Ocean gliders are quiet, buoyancy-driven, long-endurance, profiling autonomous platforms. Gliders therefore possess unique advantages as platforms for Passive Acoustic Monitoring ({PAM}) of the marine environment. In this paper, we review available glider platforms and passive acoustic monitoring systems, and explore current and potential uses of passive acoustic monitoring-equipped gliders for the study of physical oceanography, biology, ecology and for regulatory purposes. We evaluate limiting factors for passive acoustic monitoring glider surveys, such as platform-generated and flow noise, weight, size and energy constraints, profiling ability and slow movement. Based on data from 34 passive acoustic monitoring glider missions, it was found that {\textless}13\% of the time spent at sea was unsuitable for passive acoustic monitoring measurements, either because of surface communications or glider manoeuvre, leaving the remainder available for subsequent analysis. To facilitate the broader use of passive acoustic monitoring gliders, we document best practices and include workarounds for the typical challenges of a passive acoustic monitoring glider mission. Three research priorities are also identified to improve future passive acoustic monitoring glider observations: 1) Technological developments to improve sensor integration and preserve glider endurance; 2) improved sampling methods and statistical analysis techniques to perform population density estimation from passive acoustic monitoring glider observations; and 3) calibration of the passive acoustic monitoring glider to record absolute noise levels, for anthropogenic noise monitoring. It is hoped this methodological review will assist glider users to broaden the observational capability of their instruments, and help researchers in related fields to deploy passive acoustic monitoring gliders in their studies.},

	abstract = {In 2017, an endangered North Atlantic right whale mortality event in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, triggered the implementation of dynamic mitigation measures that required real-time information on whale distribution. Underwater glider-based acoustic monitoring offers a possible solution for collecting near real-time information but has many practical challenges including self-noise, energy restrictions, and computing capacity, as well as limited glider-to-shore data transfer bandwidth. This paper describes the development of a near real-time baleen whale acoustic monitoring glider system and its evaluation in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2018. Development focused on identifying and prioritizing important acoustic events and on sending contextual information to shore for human validation. The system performance was evaluated post-retrieval, then the trial was simulated using optimized parameters. Trial simulation evaluation revealed that the validated detections of right, fin, and blue whales produced by the system were all correct; the proportion of species occurrence missed varied depending on the timeframe considered. Glider-based near real-time monitoring can be an effective and reliable technique to inform dynamic mitigation strategies for species such as the North Atlantic right whale.},

	abstract = {Owls play important cultural, ecological, and indicator roles throughout the world. Yet owls’ cryptic behavior has led to uncertainties about their basic ecology, including foraging, communication, and functional roles within the community, and potentially hindered the implementation of effective conservation measures. Here we demonstrate the potential for next-generation {GPS} tags capable of recording high-precision, minute-by-minute locations paired with other technologies to resolve some of these uncertainties. We combined high-precision {GPS} tagging data with infrared ({IR}) video recorded by arboreally-mounted cameras at 5 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) nest sites in the Sierra Nevada, {USA} to provide a uniquely detailed examination of owl foraging patterns. Our approach allowed us to identify the precise time and location of 54 predation events and prey identity. We also used high-precision {GPS} tags with on-board audio recorders to map the vocal activity of 8 individuals by matching the time of vocalizations in the audio data to {GPS} locations recorded at one-minute intervals. The combined spatial and acoustic data revealed that nonbreeding males had the most widespread territorial vocal activity (i.e., producing 4-note territorial calls), while females provisioning fledglings displayed extensive nonterritorial vocal activity (i.e., producing many contact calls). Thus, the {GPS}-tag technologies we employed can provide opportunities to better understand owl foraging, communication, territoriality, and population dynamics. The methods we describe are time- and resource-intensive but can be paired with techniques that are more applicable at landscape scales, such as stable isotope analyses, {LiDAR}-based habitat analyses, and passive acoustic monitoring to link local processes to broad-scale ecological patterns. Therefore, our approach could be applied to many species whose behavior inhibits direct observation. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

When cornered, burrowing owls produce a vocal hiss that has been suggested to mimic a rattlesnake's rattle. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment using two populations of Douglas ground squirrels that differ in their evolutionary histories with rattlesnakes. Both squirrel populations were sympatric with burrowing owls. Squirrels from a population subjected to natural selection by rattlesnakes treated the owl hiss as cautiously as they did the rattle, and responded with greater caution to the rattle and hiss than to two control sounds. Squirrels from a rattlesnake-free area, however, were less systematic in differentiating among the rattle, the hiss, and the control treatments. Such variation between ground-squirrel populations provides evidence that the burrowing owl's defensive hiss currently functions as an acoustic Batesian mimic of a rattlesnake's rattle.},

	abstract = {Mitigation translocations are increasing and if they are to fulfill their regulatory intent, the application of best-practice principles to release strategy and monitoring is required. With an investment of 3 years, we engaged with stakeholders, including developers, to improve outcomes from mitigation translocations of an at-risk species, the western burrowing owl Athene cunicularia hypugaea ({BUOW}). We evaluated the consequences of two primary translocation methods, displacement (i.e. exclusion from burrow) and translocation, against control owls, using a suite of success metrics focused on dispersal, survival and reproduction. We also tested the provision of visual and acoustic conspecific cues to dampen dispersal away from release sites. Within the displaced group, {BUOW} settled closer to the origin site if burrows were available nearby. Although translocated {BUOW} dispersed farther from the release site than displaced {BUOW}, this difference disappeared when conspecific cues were present. {BUOW} were 20 times more likely to settle at the release site when conspecifics or their cues were present. Translocating animals over longer distances ({\textgreater}17.5 km) reduced the incidence of {BUOW} returning to the origin site. When avoiding direct impacts to {BUOW} is not feasible, a determination of the most beneficial translocation method must be made, driven by site-specific conditions and the feasibility of implementing best management practices. The known costs of translocation to survival may be offset by long-term advantages such as the establishment of breeding populations inside protected areas. Mitigation translocations can benefit from carefully devised and tested hypotheses to determine what works and what does not; we advocate the increased use of evidence in mitigation translocation to guide management decisions and policies.},

The remarkable similarity between the burrowing owl's defensive hiss and the rattlesnake's rattling reflects both exaptation and adaptation.

	abstract = {Most bats catch nocturnal prey during active flight guided by echolocation but some species depart from this ancestral behaviour to capture ground prey using passive listening. Here, we explore the costs and benefits of these hunting transitions by combining high-resolution biologging data and {DNA} metabarcoding to quantify the relative contributions of aerial and ground prey to the total food intake of wild greater mouse-eared bats. We show that these bats use both foraging strategies with similar average nightly captures of 25 small, aerial insects and 30 large, ground-dwelling insects per bat, but with higher capture success in air (78 \% in air vs 30 \% on ground). However, owing to the 3 to 20 times heavier ground prey, 85 \% of the estimated nightly food acquisition comes from ground prey despite the 2.5 times higher failure rates. Further, we find that most bats use the same foraging strategy on a given night suggesting that bats adapt their hunting behaviour to weather and ground conditions. We conclude that prey switching matched to environmental dynamics plays a key role in covering the energy intake even in specialised predators.},

Passive Acoustic Monitoring ({PAM}) systems can be deployed for long periods and can collect large volumes of data, becoming impractical for human operators to manually process due to the significant effort required. Many signal processing algorithms to automate this process have been produced with mixed results. Some are focused on the identification of single species while others handle a variety. No single algorithm is ideal for detecting and classifying all species concurrently, so any automated system requires a suite of these algorithms.

Correct classification scores for individual species ranged from 71\% to 92\%, with an overall correct classification score of 84\% for all five species.

Each section assesses the principles behind using the respective technology and provides recent examples of research and management applications for marine mammals and fish. The section on archival sensors highlights the need for continued development of automated acoustic detectors to assess large data sets. Case studies are presented of detectors developed for determining seasonal occurrence and distribution of haddock sounds and humpback whale vocalizations. Also presented are studies of other applications using archival sensors: tracking singing humpback whales in Brazil, using vocalizations to assess the reproductive strategies of Arctic bearded seals and assessing regional variability in call patterns for North Atlantic right whales. The section on real-time passive acoustic sensors focuses on real-time buoys and towed arrays. Case studies presented include a real-time buoy system used for monitoring endangered North Atlantic right whales and a stationary autonomous array providing real-time access to Antarctic acoustic data. The value of using towed arrays for real-time applications is also assessed, and a case study is provided on the use of towed arrays to improve abundance estimates of North Pacific cetaceans and to better understand vocalization behaviors.},

	abstract = {An acoustic survey of Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) was conducted off the U.S. West Coast in August and September 2016 using drifting recorder systems with a vertical array of two hydrophones at a depth of 110 m. Recorders were deployed 22 times to representatively cover a 1,058,000 km2 study area from the shelf break to 556 km offshore. Vertical angles to echolocation pulses were measured using the signal time-difference-of-arrival on the two hydrophones. Echolocation pulses of Cuvier's beaked whales were identified from their arrival angles (always from below the array) and unique acoustic characteristics. The density and abundance of Cuvier's beaked whales were estimated using a group-based point-transect analysis with 2 min time snapshots. The area effectively surveyed was estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood approach to fit the observed distribution of signal arrival angles. The acoustic availability of whales during their dive cycle was estimated from the duration of acoustic encounters using a mark-recapture approach. Overall, Cuvier's beaked whales were present during 0.60\% of snapshots, and their estimated average density is 5.12 animals per 1,000 km2 ({CV} = 0.27). Their estimated abundance in the study area is 5,454 individuals (95\% credibility intervals: 3,151 to 8,907).},

Multinational naval {ASW} exercises have used {MFAS} offshore of the Mariana Archipelago semi-annually since 2006. We report {BW} and {MFAS} acoustic activity near the islands of Saipan and Tinian from March 2010 to November 2014. Signals from Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), and a third unidentified {BW} species, were detected throughout the recording period. Both recorders documented {MFAS} on 21 August 2011 before two Cuvier's beaked whales stranded on 22–23 August 2011. We compared the history of known naval operations and {BW} strandings from the Mariana Archipelago to consider potential threats to {BW} populations. Eight {BW} stranding events between June 2006 and January 2019 each included one to three animals. Half of these strandings occurred during or within 6 days after naval activities, and this co-occurrence is highly significant. We highlight strandings of individual {BWs} can be associated with {ASW}, and emphasize the value of ongoing passive acoustic monitoring, especially for beaked whales that are difficult to visually detect at sea. We strongly recommend more visual monitoring efforts, at sea and along coastlines, for stranded cetaceans before, during and after naval exercises.},

Comparing overlapping periods of visual surveys and acoustic monitoring confirmed presence of 12 cetacean species/species groups within the study region. Seasonal patterns were identified for blue, fin, humpback, grey and sperm whale acoustic signals. Killer whale and delphinid acoustic signals occurred year-round on both coasts of Haida Gwaii and showed strong diel variation. Cuvier’s, Baird’s, beaked whale and porpoise clicks, were identified in high-frequency recordings on the west coast. Correlations between environmental factors, chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature, and cetacean acoustic occurrence off Gwaii Haanas were also examined. This study is the first to acoustically monitor Gwaii Haanas waters for an extended continuous period and therefore serves as a baseline from which to monitor future changes.},

We used passive acoustic monitoring to describe the vocal behaviour of sei whales in the Falkland Islands, between December 2018 and April 2019. We isolated more than 2000 low-frequency calls for manual classification, of which 510 calls with high signal-to-noise ratio were quantitatively measured. Five categories of stereotyped call types in the 15–230 Hz range were described, some with multiple subcategories. These included some similar to previously described calls (e.g. downsweeps), but others that were novel in acoustic structure and frequency band. In the mid-frequency range, we documented a highly stereotyped, hierarchically structured and rhythmically repetitive song display. Songs were arranged in phrases with a structure composed of repetitive sub-phrases, and a diverse variety of sounds in the 1–5 {kHz} range. Singing commenced in late February, despite the presence of whales and calls since early December, and continued through April. These acoustic properties and behavioural characteristics indicate that this is likely a male breeding display similar to songs and singing of other balaenopterids. This is the first detailed description of a song display for sei whales, highlighting the importance of the Falkland Islands.},

	abstract = {In the Southern California Bight, the common dolphin Delphinus delphis is the most abundant dolphin species and preys upon small pelagic fish, mesopelagic fish, and cephalopods. Mesopelagic fish and many cephalopods are available throughout the year, and they form deep scattering layers, some of which characteristically undergo strong diel vertical migrations. The extent of vertical migration depends on the degree of sea surface solar and lunar illumination. At their daytime depth, mesopelagic prey are beyond the range of shallow-diving dolphins. Autonomous acoustic recorders were used to monitor dolphin echolocation at 2 offshore recording locations from 2009 to 2014. Manual and automated classification techniques were used to identify periods of high echolocation activity, indicative of common dolphin foraging. Clear lunar patterns existed in cool months, when echolocation activity was highest during the darkest periods of the night and lunar month, indicating times when dolphins were foraging, possibly on mesopelagic prey. Echolocation was more abundant during warm months, but diel and lunar patterns in echolocation were weaker. Generalized additive mixed models show that the observed patterns in echolocation activity are correlated with lunar day and position of the moon in the night sky. Seasonal patterns may represent geographic shifts in common dolphin populations, shoaling scattering layers, or prey switching behavior during the warm months, whereby dolphins target small pelagic fish not associated with the deep scattering layers. Overall, dolphin foraging activity declined from 2009 to 2014 during warm months, which may be related to a declining abundance of small pelagic fish.},

	abstract = {Belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are highly social Arctic toothed whales with large vocal repertoires and similar acoustic profiles. Passive Acoustic Monitoring ({PAM}) that uses multiple hydrophones over large spatiotemporal scales has been a primary method to study their populations, particularly in response to rapid climate change and increasing underwater noise. This study marks the first acoustic comparison between wild belugas and narwhals from the same location and reveals that they can be acoustically differentiated and classified solely by echolocation clicks. Acoustic recordings were made in the pack ice of Baffin Bay, West Greenland, during 2013. Multivariate analyses and Random Forests classification models were applied to eighty-one single-species acoustic events comprised of numerous echolocation clicks. Results demonstrate a significant difference between species’ acoustic parameters where beluga echolocation was distinguished by higher frequency content, evidenced by higher peak frequencies, center frequencies, and frequency minimums and maximums. Spectral peaks, troughs, and center frequencies for beluga clicks were generally {\textgreater} 60 {kHz} and narwhal clicks {\textless} 60 {kHz} with overlap between 40–60 {kHz}. Classification model predictive performance was strong with an overall correct classification rate of 97.5\% for the best model. The most important predictors for species assignment were defined by peaks and notches in frequency spectra. Our results provide strong support for the use of echolocation in {PAM} efforts to differentiate belugas and narwhals acoustically.},

	abstract = {At least ten species of beaked whales inhabit the North Pacific, but little is known about their abundance, ecology, and behavior, as they are elusive and difficult to distinguish visually at sea. Six of these species produce known species-specific frequency modulated ({FM}) echolocation pulses: Baird’s, Blainville’s, Cuvier’s, Deraniyagala’s, Longman’s, and Stejneger’s beaked whales. Additionally, one described {FM} pulse ({BWC}) from Cross Seamount, Hawai’i, and three unknown {FM} pulse types ({BW}40, {BW}43, {BW}70) have been identified from almost 11 cumulative years of autonomous recordings at 24 sites throughout the North Pacific. Most sites had a dominant {FM} pulse type with other types being either absent or limited. There was not a strong seasonal influence on the occurrence of these signals at any site, but longer time series may reveal smaller, consistent fluctuations. Only the species producing {BWC} signals, detected throughout the Pacific Islands region, consistently showed a diel cycle with nocturnal foraging. By comparing stranding and sighting information with acoustic findings, we hypothesize that {BWC} signals are produced by ginkgo-toothed beaked whales. {BW}43 signal encounters were restricted to Southern California and may be produced by Perrin’s beaked whale, known only from Californian waters. {BW}70 signals were detected in the southern Gulf of California, which is prime habitat for Pygmy beaked whales. Hubb’s beaked whale may have produced the {BW}40 signals encountered off central and southern California; however, these signals were also recorded off Pearl and Hermes Reef and Wake Atoll, which are well south of their known range.},

	abstract = {Mixed-species bird flocks are dynamic associations that exhibit compositional turnover over relatively small timescales. Morphological similarity and foraging behaviour of species in flocks influence the relative benefits and costs of flock participation. In addition, acoustic signals serve many critical life-history functions in birds, including within flocks. However, the role of acoustic signals in flock assembly remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the relationship between acoustic and morphological trait spaces of bird flocks in Peninsular India, using a phylogenetically informed framework. We found that participant species were generally more similar in body mass than expected by chance, and flocks in general were dominated by smaller-sized species. Conversely, we found that flock participants did not exhibit this pattern of similarity for acoustic frequency traits. Thus, in spite of the correlation of vocal frequency with traits such as body size and bill size, body mass and spectral signal space were decoupled at the community scale. This may enable species to derive distinct sets of benefits from both sets of traits and provides valuable insight into the dynamic processes driving flock assembly.},

	abstract = {Vocal communication is broadly distributed in a wide range of nonhuman animal species and is hypothesized to play an important role in mate attraction, territory defence, predator avoidance and parental care. Understanding the ecological and social drivers of vocal communication is key to enhancing our understanding of the evolution of social structures, mating systems and group dynamics. We reviewed 130 studies investigating vocal communication in the family of corvids. As oscine passerines, living in complex and flexible social systems and a wide range of ecological systems (e.g. different habitats, trophic niches), corvids present a key model group in advancing our understanding of evolutionary drivers of vocal communication. Here, we outline empirical evidence for vocal learning, ecological adaptation (e.g. calls encoding information about predator type) and social adaptation (e.g. vocalizations for group cohesion and coordination) in corvid vocalizations and behavioural responses of receivers to calls. Only 35 out of 128 (27\%) of corvid species have been studied with regards to their vocal communication. While some species, like American crows, common ravens and Eurasian magpies, are well studied, and supporting evidence for vocal learning and ecological as well as social adaptations is available, most corvid species remain poorly studied. We hope our review will inspire future work on previously underinvestigated corvid species, as well as replications of previous research with standardized observational and experimental paradigms, to allow for direct comparison between different corvid species. More broadly, further research systematically investigating social and ecological factors driving variation in vocal communication systems is necessary to further advance our general understanding of animal vocal communication.},

Passive acoustic monitoring, normally performed using moored-anchored systems, is commonly used to assess ocean soundscapes, vessel noise, and the presence of marine species. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of autonomous underwater gliders ({AUG}) as an alternative to traditional moored systems for monitoring and assessing ship noise levels. We conducted thorough searches in Scopus and Web of Science, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We considered 13 articles on ocean glider applications for passive surveys and 8 articles on challenges in assessing underwater ship noise levels. Our findings were supplemented with international standards and guidelines from classification societies. Gliders are effective platforms for ship noise signature assessment due to their low noise signature and extended autonomy. In addition, {AUGs} can perform a 3D scan of the water column salinity, temperature, and density, which are needed to estimate sound propagation loss accurately. Further research is required to assess the potential of {AUGs} for accurately estimating ship noise levels by integrating oceanographic and acoustic data.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the use of passive acoustic monitoring ({PAM}) for biological and ecological applications, and a corresponding increase in the volume of data generated. However, data sets are often becoming so sizable that analysing them manually is increasingly burdensome and unrealistic. Fortunately, we have also seen a corresponding rise in computing power and the capability of machine learning algorithms, which offer the possibility of performing some of the analysis required for {PAM} automatically. Nonetheless, the field of automatic detection of acoustic events is still in its infancy in biology and ecology. In this review, we examine the trends in bioacoustic {PAM} applications, and their implications for the burgeoning amount of data that needs to be analysed. We explore the different methods of machine learning and other tools for scanning, analysing, and extracting acoustic events automatically from large volumes of recordings. We then provide a step-by-step practical guide for using automatic detection in bioacoustics. One of the biggest challenges for the greater use of automatic detection in bioacoustics is that there is often a gulf in expertise between the biological sciences and the field of machine learning and computer science. Therefore, this review first presents an overview of the requirements for automatic detection in bioacoustics, intended to familiarise those from a computer science background with the needs of the bioacoustics community, followed by an introduction to the key elements of machine learning and artificial intelligence that a biologist needs to understand to incorporate automatic detection into their research. We then provide a practical guide to building an automatic detection pipeline for bioacoustic data, and conclude with a discussion of possible future directions in this field.},

Of 191 interactions between members of this seasonally breeding, socially monogamous species, 52 were with adult foxes in the same social group, 43 with adult foxes from other known social groups, 48 with juveniles (\&lt;1 year old), and 48 with unknown foxes. Most interactions (n = 173), especially those between pair-mates, between females, and with juveniles, were affiliative. Agonistic encounters were rare (n = 18) and occurred mostly between males of different social groups and with unknown foxes. Interaction rates with social group members, most of which were pair-mates (88\%), peaked in the months before the annual mating season, whereas those with non-social group foxes, most of which represented potential extrapair copulation partners (79\%), peaked later and more sharply. The duration of interactions with adult social and non-social group foxes was highest during the mating season. Increased social interactions at this time may help foxes strengthen bonds with pair-mates and become familiar with potential extrapair partners.},

Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen "pseudo-absences" to the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and logistic regression—specifically, we show that as the number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.},

Despite their importance, there are contrasting views on the required conservation and management needs for species within this group. In a review of the {IUCN} Red List species-level assessments, we found that 53 small carnivore species were threatened ({CR}, {EN}, or {VU}) compared to 15 large. However, there were similar proportions of large (4\%, 9\%) and small (1\%, 9\%) carnivores endangered with extinction ({CR} or {EN}, respectively). We did not find support for small carnivores benefiting from mesopredator release in a global context; more than half of both large and small carnivore species decreasing, suggesting parallel declines. On average, large carnivores received their first {IUCN} assessment 10 years before small and, since their first assessment, small carnivores have received fewer assessments than large, highlighting the disparity in conservation attention within the guild. The leading threats for all carnivores include biological resource use and land use change. We review the major threats to threatened small carnivores and suggest areas for priority research and conservation. Collectively, we show that small carnivores are as endangered with extinction as are large carnivores, and that small carnivores should be of conservation concern globally, but particularly in species-rich regions of Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Madagascar. To inform conservation, we encourage more research into the basic ecology and demography of small carnivores, particularly regarding current and future threats in the face of global change.},

Females moved least in summer and most in autumn, but males showed no seasonal trend in movements. The average stay in a single den was 1.3 days. I found no effect of the closeness of approach of the den observer on the distance moved between successive dens. Ringtails used a variety of den settings: rocks, trees, shrubs, rocks and shrubs, and holes in the ground. Males used trees and rocks more and shrubs less than females. In summer and autumn, ringtails used rocks more and shrubs less than expected, and in winter ringtails used rocks less and shrubs and holes in the ground more than expected. There was no tendency to reuse certain types of dens, and 31.6\% of dens were reoccupied at least once. Most ringtails died before the age of 4 due to predation, resulting in an annual survival rate of 0.375. Contrary to the popular conception that ringtails require open, permanent water for survival, 16 of 18 ringtail home ranges had no water source within them, and no ringtail was observed in the vicinity of water. Latrines of ≥2 scats contained 89.4\% of scats found. As measured by frequency of occurrence in scats, ringtails consumed primarily fruits, followed by arthropods, mammals, birds, and reptiles, Many arthropod prey were venomous or chemically defended.

	abstract = {Passive recording technologies have become a valuable tool for ecologists to accumulate large data sets on vocalizing species assemblages and to study the response of biodiversity to regional and global environmental change. However, the process of interpreting these recordings and identifying species can be time-consuming. To automate this process, and to derive diversity metrics directly from the audio files, soundscape ecologists developed and published many bioacoustics indices, which are calculated using computer algorithms that mathematically summarize the acoustic energy in a recording. Of these indices, the acoustic complexity index ({ACI}) is perhaps the most widely proposed surrogate of bird species richness. Although several studies have shown the {ACI} to have positive correlations with species richness, it remains unknown how well the {ACI} will perform over large, habitat-diverse, regions. Our aim, here, was to examine whether site-level bird species richness (alpha diversity) correlated with the {ACI} across a large heterogenous mountain region. Further, we explored whether the elevational trends for alpha diversity and the {ACI} exhibited similar unimodal patterns with corresponding maximums and whether any shifts in the elevation of these maximums could be tracked over time in response to climate change. We deployed recording devices along two extensive transects on the Pacific Crest Trail in California, {USA}; these included a 689-km trail section in northern California and a 531-km section in southern California. Point counts for birds from the field were combined with the interpretation of the recordings to estimate alpha diversity using a Bayesian multispecies occupancy model. We found that alpha diversity exhibited a positive linear relationship with the {ACI} on both trail sections. However, these relationships were not strong (low R2 values). Similar mid-elevation maximums for alpha diversity and the {ACI} were observed along the northern trail section. Power analysis revealed that with repeated annual surveys using our protocols, we could detect an average shift in the elevation of either maximum species richness or {ACI} of approximately 100 m over 20 years (i.e., 5 m/yr), which could be improved in precision to 50 m (i.e., 2.5 m/yr) with a 5-fold increase in survey effort. Although there was considerable unexplained variation in our diversity- and {ACI}-elevation trends, which we suspect was due to microhabitat and microclimate effects, we concluded that the {ACI} was a useful, albeit coarse, surrogate of alpha diversity across large regions. The {ACI} warrants consideration by ecologists and land managers for application in large-scale monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {Growing research on the function of female birdsong now allows for identification of large-scale patterns emerging in the published literature. We conducted a review that analysed female birdsong function studies to characterize the literature and research approaches in this field. We examined when, where and how researchers study female birdsong function and then quantified which functions for female song were most often supported by authors. Our data set included studies published between 1900 and 2022 that concentrated on singing female birds and either investigated or addressed functions of solo female song directly. The number of female song studies published per year has increased rapidly in recent decades, with the majority of the work focused on North/Central American species, followed by Australian and South American species. Most research studies used natural observation techniques, about half used playback and only 21\% used other manipulations. In 67\% of the studies analysed, female song was reported to be used in defence of a territory, 43\% of studies reported intrasexual competition/aggression and 45\% reported intrapair communication. Mate attraction and parent–offspring communication were the song functions least often supported and least often tested by authors. Most authors identified multiple contexts in which female song functioned in each study species. Outcomes match the demonstrated multifunctionality of male birdsong. In contrast, females apparently use song for mate attraction much less than male birds do. Surprisingly, less than 10\% of papers directly linked female song behaviour to reproductive success, a connection providing critical support for ultimate explanations of function. It is evident that scientific interest in female birdsong function is on the rise. Our review identified a need for future research to include African and Asian avian species and studies that comprehensively test the fitness correlates of female birdsong function.},

	abstract = {This chapter is a collection of brief articles on topics in underwater acoustics. It starts with an overview of the complexity of the acoustic signals resulting from installation and operation of renewable energy systems and the efforts required to measure and interpret those signals. This is followed by a discussion of the United Nations' Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization's Hydro-acoustic sites in strategic locations in the world's oceans and their expertise in understanding low-frequency acoustic noise and the opportunity for researchers to take advantage of continuous recording that in many cases are more than a decade of time. The Characterization of Noise from Ships is both a classic and a modern view of the features of radiated energy from naval vessels. Underwater Soundscapes is a new look at understanding and interpreting noise fields. It is an especially valuable methodology for separating the myriad of oceanic noise sources. Underwater Acoustic Communications provides an introduction to the issues in that field. Underwater Archaeology is an introduction to a fascinating science that benefits greatly from the ability of high-frequency acoustic energy to image in a competitive way with visual means, but over useful ranges, the artifacts of our forebears. Applications of Underwater Acoustics in Polar Environments is very timely, given the renewed interest in these regions due to accessibility caused by global warming. Tank Experiments provides a modern review of ongoing facilities and efforts for cost-effective alternatives to at-sea experiments. Acoustic Positioning at Sea provides an overview of the forcing functions in and on the sea that make the exact position determination a daunting task. Ocean Observing Systems and Ocean Observatories, Oceanographers and Acousticians provides a complete summary of ongoing efforts and a perspective on the long and fruitful relationship between the scientists of both disciplines. Applications of Underwater Acoustics to Military Purposes is a complete, and brief, review of its use in various aspects of Naval Warfare.},

	abstract = {Ocean gliders are versatile and efﬁcient passive acoustic monitoring platforms in remote marine environments, but few studies have examined their potential to monitor ship underwater noise. This study investigates a Slocum glider’s capability to assess ship noise compared to the ability of ﬁxed observers. Trials were conducted in shallow coastal inlets and deep bays in Newfoundland, Canada, using a glider, hydrophone array, and single-moored system. The study focused on (1) the glider’s self-noise signature, (2) range-depth-dependent propagation loss ({PL}) models, and (3) identifying the location of the vessel to the glider using glider acoustic measurements. The primary contributors to the glider’s self-noise were the buoyancy pump and rudder. The pitch-motor noise coincided with the buoyancy pump activation and did not contribute to the glider self-noise in our experiments. {PL} models showed that seaﬂoor bathymetry and sound speed proﬁles signiﬁcantly impacted estimates compared to models assuming ﬂat and range-independent proﬁles. The glider’s performance in recording ship noise was superior to that of other platforms. Using its hydrophones, the glider could identify the bearing from the vessel, although a third hydrophone would improve reliability and provide range. The ﬁndings demonstrate that gliders can characterize noise and enhance our understanding of ocean sound sources. {VC} 2024 Author(s).

Passive acoustic monitoring, normally performed using moored-anchored systems, is commonly used to assess ocean soundscapes, vessel noise, and the presence of marine species. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of autonomous underwater gliders ({AUG}) as an alternative to traditional moored systems for monitoring and assessing ship noise levels. We conducted thorough searches in Scopus and Web of Science, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We considered 13 articles on ocean glider applications for passive surveys and 8 articles on challenges in assessing underwater ship noise levels. Our findings were supplemented with international standards and guidelines from classification societies. Gliders are effective platforms for ship noise signature assessment due to their low noise signature and extended autonomy. In addition, {AUGs} can perform a 3D scan of the water column salinity, temperature, and density, which are needed to estimate sound propagation loss accurately. Further research is required to assess the potential of {AUGs} for accurately estimating ship noise levels by integrating oceanographic and acoustic data.},

Autonomous platforms and vehicles are a growing component of the ocean research fleet, producing data sets crucial to our understanding of oceanographic and fishery ecosystem processes. One emerging tool for making these measurements is underwater gliders that autonomously
sample the water column for weeks to months at a time. Although originally designed to measure temperature and salinity, underwater gliders can now support a myriad of sensors. For the demonstration project described within, three complementary acoustic technologies were integrated into an
underwater glider for mapping fish on the continental shelf: an acoustic telemetry receiver, a passive acoustic monitoring recorder, and a fisheries echosounder.The demonstration project was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of each sensing technology. Sixty-one fish were implanted
with acoustic tags near the Gulfstream Natural Gas pipeline in the eastern Gulf of Mexico in advance of planned underwater glider missions. The glider was deployed four times over 12 months, with all three acoustic technologies to traverse the pipeline and surrounding habitat. Glider detections
were compared to detections of fish at moored acoustic tag telemetry receivers and passive acoustic recorders co-located at the tagged fish locations. All three technologies identified fish along the targeted hard-bottom pipeline habitat, as well as previously uncharted areas of hard-bottom
reef. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of gliders integrated with acoustic sensors as a potential tool to identify areas that merit deeper investigation to assess fish stocks.},

The Seaglider, a type of underwater glider, is a relatively quiet vehicle in comparison with propelled autonomous underwater vehicles, making it a desirable acoustic receiving platform. Vehicle operations, such as pumping/bleeding oil to change buoyancy, shifting/rotating
the battery to change pitch/roll, and oceanographic data collection, do, however, produce some self-noise. This system performance study analyzes the prevalence, frequency content, duration, and levels of self-noise associated with vehicle operations using data collected with a passive acoustic
monitoring system mounted on the body of a Seaglider vehicle. Guidance and control functions, including pitch, roll, and buoyancy changes, were the major source of platform noise, producing broadband noise ranging from less than a second to over 3 min in duration, with sound pressure levels
of 120‐145.5 {dB} re 1{μPa}. Frequencies below 10 {kHz} were the most impacted by self-noise, with a maximum 1/3 octave level of 137.5 {dB} re 1{μPa} in the 2.5kHz band caused by the pumping of oil in the variable buoyancy device. Guidance and control changes occurred during 4\%‐13\%
of the dive for dives greater than 500 m. The bulk of these operations, however, were performed near the surface and apogee of the dive and typically affected only about 6\% of the dive cycle duration for deep dives.},

	abstract = {Animals produce a wide array of sounds with highly variable acoustic structures. It is possible to understand the causes and consequences of this variation across taxa with phylogenetic comparative analyses. Acoustic and evolutionary analyses are rapidly increasing in sophistication such that choosing appropriate acoustic and evolutionary approaches is increasingly difficult. However, the correct choice of analysis can have profound effects on output and evolutionary inferences. Here, we identify and address some of the challenges for this growing field by providing a roadmap for quantifying and comparing sound in a phylogenetic context for researchers with a broad range of scientific backgrounds. Sound, as a continuous, multidimensional trait can be particularly challenging to measure because it can be hard to identify variables that can be compared across taxa and it is also no small feat to process and analyse the resulting high-dimensional acoustic data using approaches that are appropriate for subsequent evolutionary analysis. Additionally, terminological inconsistencies and the role of learning in the development of acoustic traits need to be considered. Phylogenetic comparative analyses also have their own sets of caveats to consider. We provide a set of recommendations for delimiting acoustic signals into discrete, comparable acoustic units. We also present a three-stage workflow for extracting relevant acoustic data, including options for multivariate analyses and dimensionality reduction that is compatible with phylogenetic comparative analysis. We then summarize available phylogenetic comparative approaches and how they have been used in comparative bioacoustics, and address the limitations of comparative analyses with behavioural data. Lastly, we recommend how to apply these methods to acoustic data across a range of study systems. In this way, we provide an integrated framework to aid in quantitative analysis of cross-taxa variation in animal sounds for comparative phylogenetic analysis. In addition, we advocate the standardization of acoustic terminology across disciplines and taxa, adoption of automated methods for acoustic feature extraction, and establishment of strong data archival practices for acoustic recordings and data analyses. Combining such practices with our proposed workflow will greatly advance the reproducibility, biological interpretation, and longevity of comparative bioacoustic studies.},

	abstract = {This study examines the occurrence of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song in the northeast Pacific from three years of continuous recordings off central California (36.713°N, 122.186°W). Song is prevalent in this feeding and migratory habitat, spanning nine months of the year (September–May), peaking in winter (November–January), and reaching a maximum of 86\% temporal coverage (during November 2017). From the rise of song in fall through the end of peak occurrence in winter, song length increases significantly from month to month. The seasonal peak in song coincides with the seasonal trough in day length and sighting-based evidence of whales leaving Monterey Bay, consistent with seasonal migration. During the seasonal song peak, diel variation shows maximum occurrence at night (69\% of the time), decreasing during dawn and dusk (52\%), and further decreasing with increasing solar elevation during the day, reaching a minimum near solar noon (30\%). Song occurrence increased 44\% and 55\% between successive years. Sighting data within the acoustic detection range of the hydrophone indicate that variation in local population density was an unlikely cause of this large interannual variation. Hydrographic data and modeling of acoustic transmission indicate that changes in neither habitat occupancy nor acoustic transmission were probable causes. Conversely, the positive interannual trend in song paralleled major ecosystem variations, including similarly large positive trends in wind-driven upwelling, primary productivity, and krill abundance. Further, the lowest song occurrence during the first year coincided with anomalously warm ocean temperatures and an extremely toxic harmful algal bloom that affected whales and other marine mammals in the region. These major ecosystem variations may have influenced the health and behavior of humpback whales during the study period.},

	abstract = {Northeast Pacific blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, migrate annually between productive summer feeding grounds off North America and tropical winter breeding grounds off Central America. These migratory movements have been confirmed through acoustic monitoring of the long-duration, low-frequency sounds produced by males (type B calls). However, other calls in the species' repertoire might prove a better proxy for the migratory and foraging behaviour of the population as a whole. To explore the seasonal and daily calling behaviour of this population, we evaluated the occurrence of three blue whale call types (song B, singular B and D) recorded between 2000 and 2004 at Cortez and Tanner Banks, a summer feeding area offshore of southern California. We recorded a significant temporal separation among the type B and D calls, both seasonally and daily, suggesting preferred use of certain call types during different behavioural states. A consistent seasonal pattern was evident, with D calling from April to November and song and singular B calling from June to January. In addition, D calls were heard primarily from dawn through to dusk, in contrast to the crepuscular pattern of song, suggesting that the production of D calls is related to feeding behaviour, which occurs primarily during the day on aggregated krill at depth. An increase in the length of the overall calling season was also observed from 2000 to 2004 and may be related to increased prey availability in the Southern California Bight relative to more southerly feeding areas.},

Despite last sharing an ancestor {\textasciitilde} 2–3 million years ago, Atlantic and Pacific foraging populations share five call types. Whether these call types are also shared between allopatric breeding and foraging populations is unclear, but would provide further evidence that some call types are ubiquitous and fixed. We investigated whether these five call types were present on a contemporary foraging ground (Newfoundland, 2015–2016) and a historic breeding ground (Hawaii, 1981–1982). Calls were classified using aural/visual ({AV}) characteristics; 16 relevant acoustic variables were measured and a Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) was used to examine within-call and between-population variation. To assess whether between-population variation influenced classification, all 16 variables were included in classification and regression tree ({CART}) and random forest analyses ({RF}). All five call types were identified in both populations. Between-population variation in combined acoustic variables ({PC}1, {PC}2, {PC}3) was lower within call types than among call types, and high agreement between {AV} and quantitative classification ({CART}: 83\% agreement; {RF}: 77\% agreement) suggested that acoustic characteristics were more similar within than among call types. Findings indicate that these five call types are shared across allopatric populations, generations, and behavioural contexts.},

We examine gray whale distribution, habitat use, and abundance over 31 years (1992–2022) using standardized nearshore ({\textless} 5 km from shore) surveys spanning a large swath of the {PCFG} foraging range. Specifically, we generated density surface models, which incorporate detection probability into generalized additive models to assess environmental correlates of gray whale distribution and predict abundance over time. We illustrate the importance of coastal upwelling dynamics, whereby increased upwelling only yields higher gray whale density if interspersed with relaxation events, likely because this combination optimizes influx and retention of nutrients to support recruitment and aggregation of gray whale prey. Several habitat features influence gray whale distribution, including substrate, shelf width, prominent capes, and river estuaries. However, the influence of these features differs between regions, revealing heterogeneity in habitat preferences throughout the {PCFG} foraging range. Predicted gray whale abundance fluctuated throughout our study period, but without clear directional trends, unlike previous abundance estimates based on mark-recapture models. This study highlights the value of long-term monitoring, shedding light on the impacts of variable environmental conditions on an iconic nearshore marine predator.},

	abstract = {Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) are commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, but few studies have explored the presence of Bryde's whales at the boundary of their distribution range. Such studies are increasingly relevant as climate impact models predict the range expansion of warm water species towards the poles in response to ocean warming. Like other baleen whales, Bryde's whales produce distinct low frequency ({\textless}60 Hz) calls, which can be used for long-term acoustic monitoring of whale presence in an area. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders deployed at five sites in the Southern California Bight ({SCB}) were used to investigate the presence of Bryde's whales in temperate waters from 2000 to 2010. Calling Bryde's whales were observed in the {SCB} from summer to early winter, indicating a seasonal poleward range expansion. There was a significant increase in the presence of calling Bryde's whales in the {SCB} between 2000 and 2010, but no significant correlation was found between Bryde's whale presence and local sea surface temperature. Bryde's whale occurrence is likely driven by prey availability within the California Current ecosystem, which is affected by seasonal and inter-annual changes in climate and oceanographic conditions. Continued monitoring of Bryde's whales and their prey in the eastern North Pacific is needed to provide a longer time series and determine the full effect of climate variability and ocean warming on the distribution of this species.},

	abstract = {Animals use varied acoustic signals that play critical roles in their lives. Understanding the function of these signals may inform about key life-history processes relevant for conservation. In the case of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), that produce different call types associated with different behaviours, several hypotheses have emerged regarding call function, but the topic still remains in its infancy. Here, we investigate the potential function of two fin whale vocalizations, the song-forming 20-Hz call and the 40-Hz call, by examining their production in relation to season, year and prey biomass. Our results showed that the production of 20-Hz calls was strongly influenced by season, with a clear peak during the breeding months, and secondarily by year, likely due to changes in whale abundance. These results support the reproductive function of the 20-Hz song used as an acoustic display. Conversely, season and year had no effect on variation in 40-Hz calling rates, but prey biomass did. This is the first study linking 40-Hz call activity to prey biomass, supporting the previously suggested food-associated function of this call. Understanding the functions of animal signals can help identifying functional habitats and predict the negative effects of human activities with important implications for conservation.},

These data encompass more than one hundred years of recording-time and capture high wind events, and were collected both on shallow continental shelves and in open ocean deep-water settings. The model aims to explicitly separate noise generated by wind-related sources from noise produced by anthropogenic sources. Two key wind-related sound-generating mechanisms considered are: surface wave and turbulence interactions, and bubble and bubble cloud oscillations. The model for wind-generated noise shows small frequency dependence (5 {dB}/decade) at low frequencies (10–100 Hz), and larger frequency dependence (∼15 {dB}/decade) at higher frequencies (400 Hz–20 {kHz}). The relationship between noise level and wind speed is linear for low wind speeds (\&lt;3.3 m/s) and increases to a higher power law (two or three) at higher wind speeds, suggesting a transition between surface wave/turbulence and bubble source mechanisms. At the highest wind speeds (\&gt;15 m/s), noise levels begin to decrease at high frequencies (\&gt;10 {kHz}), likely due to interaction between bubbles and screening of noise radiation in the presence of high-density bubble clouds.},

Very little is known about the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (K. sima and K. breviceps), including their {NBHF} pulse characteristics. This paper presents a multivariate clustering method using data from unmanned drifting acoustic recorders and visually verified porpoise recordings to discriminate between probable porpoise and Kogia clicks. Using density clustering, this study finds three distinct clusters whose geographic distributions are consistent with the known habitat range for Kogia and Dall's porpoise. A Random Forest classification model correctly assigned 97\% of the clicks to their cluster. Visually verified Dall's porpoise clicks from towed hydrophones were strongly associated with one of the clusters, while a second cluster tended to be outside the geographic range of Dall's porpoise and unlike the Dall's porpoise cluster. These clicks, presumed to be made by Kogia, exhibited greater spectral variance than previous Kogia echolocation studies. It is possible that the structure of Kogia {NBHF} pulses may not be as stereotypical as previously described.},

In terms of anthropophony, shipping has been found to be the greatest (ubiquitous and continuous) contributor of low-frequency underwater noise in several northern hemisphere soundscapes. Our aim was to develop a model for ship noise in Australian waters, which could be used by industry and government to manage marine zones, their usage, stressors, and potential impacts. We also modelled wind noise under water to provide context to the contribution of ship noise. The models were validated with underwater recordings from 25 sites. As expected, there was good congruence when shipping or wind were the dominant sources. However, there was less agreement when other anthropogenic or biological sources were present (i.e., primarily marine seismic surveying and whales). Off Australia, pristine marine soundscapes (based on the dominance of natural, biological and physical sound) remain, in particular, near offshore reefs and islands. Strong wind noise dominates along the southern Australian coast. Underwater shipping noise dominates only in certain areas, along the eastern seaboard and on the northwest shelf, close to shipping lanes.},

Here, we advance methods to acoustically identify the only two Arctic toothed whales, the beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhal (Monodon monoceros), using echolocation clicks. Long-term acoustic recordings collected from moorings in Northwest Greenland were analyzed. Beluga and narwhal echolocation signals were distinguishable using spectrograms where beluga clicks had most energy {\textgreater}30 {kHz} and narwhal clicks had a sharp lower frequency limit near 20 {kHz}. Changes in one-third octave levels ({TOL}) between two pairs of one-third octave bands were compared from over one million click spectra. Narwhal clicks had a steep increase between the 16 and 25 {kHz} {TOL} bands that was absent in beluga click spectra. Conversely, beluga clicks had a steep increase between the 25 and 40 {kHz} {TOL} bands that was absent in narwhal click spectra. Random Forest classification models built using the 16 to 25 {kHz} and 25 to 40 {kHz} {TOL} ratios accurately predicted the species identity of 100\% of acoustic events. Our findings support the use of echolocation {TOL} ratios in future automated click classifiers for acoustic monitoring of Arctic toothed whales and potentially for other odon-tocete species.},

Understanding the function of these signals may inform about key life-history processes relevant for conservation. In the case of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), that produce different call types associated with different behaviours, several hypotheses have emerged regarding call function, but the topic still remains in its infancy. Here, we investigate the potential function of two fin whale vocalizations, the song-forming 20-Hz call and the 40-Hz call, by examining their production in relation to season, year and prey biomass. Our results showed that the production of 20-Hz calls was strongly influenced by season, with a clear peak during the breeding months, and secondarily by year, likely due to changes in whale abundance. These results support the reproductive function of the 20-Hz song used as an acoustic display. Conversely, season and year had no effect on variation in 40-Hz calling rates, but prey biomass did. This is the first study linking 40-Hz call activity to prey biomass, supporting the previously suggested food-associated function of this call. Understanding the functions of animal signals can help identifying functional habitats and predict the negative effects of human activities with important implications for conservation.},

The differences in temporal patterns between two fin whale call types are described from long-term passive acoustic data collected intermittently between 2005 and 2011 at three locations across the eastern North Pacific: the Bering Sea, off Southern California, and in Canal de Ballenas in the northern Gulf of California. Fin whale calls were detected at all sites year-round, during all periods with recordings. At all three locations, 40-Hz calls peaked in June, preceding a peak in 20-Hz calls by 3–5 months. Monitoring both call types may provide a more accurate insight into the seasonal presence of fin whales across the eastern North Pacific than can be obtained from a single call type. The 40-Hz call may be associated with a foraging function, and temporal separation between 40- and 20-Hz calls may indicate the separation between predominately feeding behavior and other social interactions.},

Recorders were deployed 22 times to representatively cover a 1,058,000 km2 study area from the shelf break to 556 km offshore. Vertical angles to echolocation pulses were measured using the signal time-difference-of-arrival on the two hydrophones. Echolocation pulses of Cuvier's beaked whales were identified from their arrival angles (always from below the array) and unique acoustic characteristics. The density and abundance of Cuvier's beaked whales were estimated using a group-based point-transect analysis with 2 min time snapshots. The area effectively surveyed was estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood approach to fit the observed distribution of signal arrival angles. The acoustic availability of whales during their dive cycle was estimated from the duration of acoustic encounters using a mark-recapture approach. Overall, Cuvier's beaked whales were present during 0.60\% of snapshots, and their estimated average density is 5.12 animals per 1,000 km2 ({CV} = 0.27). Their estimated abundance in the study area is 5,454 individuals (95\% credibility intervals: 3,151 to 8,907).},

	abstract = {Characterizing population structure and dynamics is critical for the conservation of endangered species. Monitoring sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus is especially difficult because it requires monitoring different latitudes to capture the dynamics of most populations. Since their remarkable sexual dimorphism in body size is reflected in their sounds, passive acoustic monitoring presents an opportunity to capture contiguous patterns in time, space, and over large scales. We show that the echolocation repetition rate (measured as inter-click interval, {ICI}) as a proxy for body length is a suitable approach for large-scale acoustic monitoring. Body length has previously been estimated from the time interval between pulses ({IPI}) within sperm whale echolocation clicks. These estimates can only be achieved when whales are oriented toward the recorder or directly facing away, resulting in sparse data. A representative subsample of data demonstrated that {ICI} and {IPI} are linearly correlated, allowing conversion of {ICI} distributions into likely body length categories. This approach was applied to three monitoring sites in the Gulf of Mexico (2010–2017), where sperm whale population structure and male movements were poorly understood. We identified three classes: large animals between 12–15 m ({ICI} between 0.72 and 1 sec), presumed to correspond to adult males, and small animals below 12 m ({ICI} between 0.44 and 0.64 sec) likely pertaining to social groups (mixed groups with adult females and their offspring), and the third class with mid-sized animals ({ICI} between 0.64 and 0.83 sec) believed to contain adult females or sub-adult males. Our results revealed spatial and seasonal variability of the population structure including possible male presence throughout the year and migratory patterns of the population. This approach provides a means to efficiently characterize the putative population structure of sperm whales to understand the population's geographical dynamics and population status, which is relevant under rapidly changing habitat conditions.},

	abstract = {Conventional detection of humpback vocalizations is often based on frequency summation of band-limited spectrograms under the assumption that energy (square of the Fourier amplitude) is the appropriate metric. Power-law detectors allow for a higher power of the Fourier amplitude, appropriate when the signal occupies a limited but unknown subset of these frequencies. Shipping noise is non-stationary and colored and problematic for many marine mammal detection algorithms. Modifications to the standard power-law form are introduced to minimize the effects of this noise. These same modifications also allow for a fixed detection threshold, applicable to broadly varying ocean acoustic environments. The detection algorithm is general enough to detect all types of humpback vocalizations. Tests presented in this paper show this algorithm matches human detection performance with an acceptably small probability of false alarms ({PFA} \&lt; 6\%) for even the noisiest environments. The detector outperforms energy detection techniques, providing a probability of detection {PD} = 95\% for {PFA} \&lt; 5\% for three acoustic deployments, compared to {PFA} \&gt; 40\% for two energy-based techniques. The generalized power-law detector also can be used for basic parameter estimation and can be adapted for other types of transient sounds.},

	abstract = {Discrimination of bioacoustic signals to the species or population level is critical for using passive acoustic monitoring to study cetacean ecology. Risso's dolphins off southern California have distinctive peaks and notches in their echolocation clicks, but it was unknown whether Risso's dolphins from other geographic areas have similarly distinctive click spectra and whether populations are acoustically distinct. This study investigates using clicks for species and population identification by characterizing the spectral structure of Risso's dolphin echolocation clicks recorded over wide-ranging geographic regions including the U.S. waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and North Pacific Ocean; and international waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. All recordings with Risso's dolphin clicks exhibited the spectral peak and notch pattern described off southern California, indicating the presence of peak banding patterns is useful for species discrimination. Geographic regions were a significant explanatory factor for variability in the frequencies of click spectral peaks, with relatively higher frequency peaks and notches found off Hawaii compared to California waters and off the southeast U.S. compared to the Gulf of Mexico. In the North Atlantic Ocean, a latitudinal cline in frequencies was evident. Potential causes of acoustic variation within and among acoustic encounters are evaluated.},

Using autonomous seafloor recording packages, the spatial, diel and seasonal patterns of Pacific white-sided dolphin echolocation click activity are described for 6 locations in the Southern California Bight. Click bouts of the 2 types of Pacific white-sided dolphin echolocation clicks are identified based on their unique spectral characteristics in long-term spectral averages. Type A clicks were detected on 317 of 1959 recording days and were heard at all 6 sites, with the majority of detections occurring at San Clemente Island and Point Conception. Type B clicks were detected on 130 recording days and were only heard at the 2 southern inshore sites. Significant diel patterns were evident for both click types: Type A click bouts were detected during more hours and with higher click rates at night than during the day, while Type B click bouts exhibited the opposite behavior, with greater activity during the day. At the southern sites, both click types exhibited a fall–winter peak in seasonal occurrence. At Point Conception, where only Type A was detected, peak occurrence was during spring. The described spatial and seasonal patterns support the hypothesis that click types are population-specific, while diel patterns suggest differences in prey preferences.},

Spectral properties are compared among the five species and unique spectral peak and notch patterns are described for two species. The spectral peak mean values from Pacific white-sided dolphin clicks are 22.2, 26.6, 33.7, and 37.3kHz and from Risso’s dolphins are 22.4, 25.5, 30.5, and 38.8kHz.

Analysis of variance analyses indicate that spectral peaks and notches within the frequency band 24–35kHz are distinct between the two species and exhibit low variation within each species. Post hoc tests divide Pacific white-sided dolphin recordings into two distinct subsets containing different click types, which are hypothesized to represent the different populations that occur within the region. Bottlenose and common dolphin clicks do not show consistent patterns of spectral peaks or notches within the frequency band examined (1–100kHz).},

In 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ({NOAA}) established a long-term, continuous, low-frequency (10 Hz–2 {kHz}) passive acoustic monitoring site in the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary ({CBNMS}), located offshore of the central United States of America (U.S.) west coast, near San Francisco, {CA}. The California Current flows southward along the coast in this area, supporting a diverse community of marine animals, including several baleen whale species. Acoustic data analysis revealed that both large vessels and vocalizing baleen whales contribute to the ambient soundscape of the {CBNMS}. Sound levels fluctuated by month with the highest levels in the fall and lowest levels in the summer. Throughout the year, very low-frequency (10–100 Hz) sound levels were most variable. Vessels and whales overlap in their contributions to ambient sound levels within this range, although vessel contributions were more omnipresent, while seasonal peaks were associated with vocalizing whales. This characterization of low-frequency ambient sound levels in the {CBNMS} establishes initial baselines for an important component of this site's underwater soundscape. Standardized monitoring of soundscapes directly supports {NOAA}'s ability to evaluate and report on conditions within national marine sanctuaries.},

	abstract = {A vertical array of five hydrophones was used to measure the acoustic field in the vertical plane of singing humpback whales. Once a singer was located, two swimmers with snorkel gear were deployed to determine the orientation of the whale and position the boat so that the array could be deployed in front of the whale at a minimum standoff distance of at least 10m. The spacing of the hydrophones was 7m with the deepest hydrophone deployed at a depth of 35m. An eight-channel {TASCAM} recorder with a bandwidth of 24kHz was used to record the hydrophone signals. The location (distance and depth) of the singer was determined by computing the time of arrival differences between the hydrophone signals. The maximum source level varied between individual units in a song, with values between 151 and 173dB re 1{μPa}. One of the purposes of this study was to estimate potential sound exposure of nearby conspecifics. The acoustic field determined by considering the relative intensity of higher frequency harmonics in the signals indicated that the sounds are projected in the horizontal direction despite the singer being canted head downward anywhere from about 25° to 90°. High-frequency harmonics extended beyond 24kHz, suggesting that humpback whales may have an upper frequency limit of hearing as high as 24kHz.},

	abstract = {This study presents non-song vocalizations of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from two migratory areas off the Western Australian coast: Geographe Bay and Port Hedland. A total of 220 sounds were identified as non-song sounds in 193 hours of recordings reviewed. Of those, 68 were measured and qualitatively classified into 17 groups using their spectral features. One group ({HW}-02) had a high level of variation in terms of spectral slope. However, further classification using statistical classification methods was not possible because of the small sample size. Non-song sound frequencies varied from 9 Hz to 6 {kHz}, with the majority of sounds under 200 Hz. The duration of non-song sounds varied between 0.09 and 3.59 s. Overall, the use of spectral features allowed general classification of humpback whale sounds in a low sample size scenario that was not conducive to using quantitative methods. However, for highly variable groups, quantitative statistical classification methods (e.g., random forests) are needed to improve classification accuracy. The identification and accurate classification of a species’ acoustic repertoire is key to effectively monitor population status using acoustic techniques and to better understand the vocal behavior of the species. The results of this study improve the monitoring of humpback whales by standardizing the classification of sounds and including them in the species’ repertoire. The inclusion of non-song sounds in passive acoustic monitoring of humpback whales will add females and calves to the detection counts of otherwise only singing males.},

	abstract = {Humpback whales are renowned for the complex structured songs produced by males. A second, relatively understudied area of humpback acoustic communication concerns un-patterned sounds known as “social sounds,” produced by both males and females. These include vocalizations as well as sounds produced at the surface of the water as a result of surface behaviors (e.g., breaching, pectoral slapping). This study describes a portion of the non-song social sound repertoire of southward migrating humpbacks in Australian waters, and explores the social relevance of these sounds. On migration, humpback whales travel in social groups of varying compositions. These social groups are not stable in that humpback whales continually change group composition by splitting from, or joining with, other groups. The results of this study suggest that “breaching” and “slapping” have a communicative function. Other sounds such as “underwater blows” and “cries” were heard mainly in competitive groups while other low-frequency sounds such as “grumbles,”“snorts,”“thwops,” and “wops” may function in intra- or inter-group communication. Particular sounds (“grunts,”“groans,” and “barks”) were almost exclusive to joining pods suggesting a role in social integration. Social sounds in humpbacks may have specific social and behavioral functions relating to social group composition, and the mediation of interactions between these social groups.},

The results of this study provide a larger-scale view of the wind-driven circulation than that described through the 1981–1982 Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment ({CODE}), particularly with regard to alongshore and temporal variations. From an improved description of the frequency structure of wind and current, a very low frequency ({VLF}) signal is identified in the observed currents at frequencies below those typical of wind forcing. The majority of this {VLF} variance appears to be accounted for by persistent flow events associated with the presence of mesoscale circulation in the adjacent ocean. The longer duration of the {NCCCS} also allows an improved description of the seasonality of flow regimes off northern California. Three oceanic seasons are identified: an upwelling season (April-July), a relaxation season (August-November), and a storm season (December-March). Alongshore variations in the strength of upwelling, in the strength of the alongshore flow, both near-surface and undercurrent, and in water temperature not only are a function of latitude, as is the wind, but they also correspond to location relative to promontories, notably Cape Mendocino. Immediately south of Cape Mendocino, the near-surface flow exhibits an equatorward minimum and a temperature minimum, whereas the undercurrent exhibits a poleward maximum. Conversely, at the moorings immediately north of the cape, temperatures are a maximum and the undercurrent exhibits a minimum. The maximum in near-surface temperature relates to a minimum in upwelling; no significant correlation was found between local wind and current immediately north of Cape Mendocino. This upwelling minimum and the upwelling maximum south of the cape were also observed as persistent sea surface temperature patterns in satellite imagery.},

While physical and biological conditions in winter and spring largely adhered to prior La Niña conditions, summer and fall were very different. Similar to past La Niña events, in winter and spring coastal upwelling was either average or above average, temperature average or below average, salinity generally above average. In summer and fall, however, upwelling and temperature were generally average or slightly below average, salinity was close to average and chlorophyll a was close to average. Again, as during prior La Niña events, biomass of northern/southern copepods was above/below average off Oregon in winter, and body size of North Pacific krill in northern California was above average in winter. By contrast, later in the year the abundance of northern krill dropped off Oregon while southern copepods increased and body sizes of North Pacific krill fell in northern California. Off Oregon and Washington abundances of market squid and Pacific pompano (indicators of warm, non-typical La Niña conditions) were high. In the 20 th century, Northern anchovy recruitment tended to be high during cold conditions, but despite mostly warm conditions from 2015-2021 anchovy populations boomed and remained high in 2022. Resident seabird reproductive success, which tended in the past to increase during productive La Niña conditions was highly variable throughout the system as common murre and pelagic cormorant, experienced complete reproductive failure at Yaquina Head, Oregon while Brandt's cormorant reproduction was average. At three sampling locations off central California, however, common murre reproduction was close to or above average while both pelagic and Brandt's cormorant were above average. California sealion reproduction has been above average each year since 2016, and pup weight was also above average in 2022, likely in response not to La Niña or El Niño but continuous high abundance of anchovy. The highly variable and often unpredictable physical and biological conditions in 2022 highlight a growing disconnect between basin-scale indices and local conditions in the {CCE}.},

	abstract = {The waveforms of individual sperm whale clicks often appear as multiple pulses, which are the product of a single pulse reverberating throughout the spermaceti organ. Since there is a relationship between spermaceti organ size and total body size, it is possible to estimate a whale's length by measuring the inter-pulse intervals ({IPIs}) within its clicks. However, if a click is recorded off-axis, the {IPI} corresponding to spermaceti organ length is usually obscured. This paper presents an algorithm for automatically estimating the “true” {IPIs} of sperm whales in a recording by measuring them from on-axis clicks only. The routine works by classifying detected clicks with a support vector machine, assessing the stability of their {IPIs}, and then clustering the stable {IPIs} using Gaussian mixture models. Results show that the routine is very accurate in obtaining reliable {IPIs}, but has a high false negative rate. Nonetheless, since sperm whales click very frequently, it is possible to obtain useful {IPI} distributions with only a few minutes of recording. This algorithm makes it possible to estimate the body lengths of multiple sperm whales automatically with only one hydrophone.

          Sperm whales exhibit sexual dimorphism and sex-specific latitudinal segregation. Females and their young form social groups and are usually found in temperate and tropical latitudes, while males forage at higher latitudes. Historical whaling data and rare sightings of social groups in high latitude regions of the North Pacific, such as the Gulf of Alaska ({GOA}) and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands ({BSAI}), suggest a more nuanced distribution than previously understood. Sperm whales are the most sighted and recorded cetacean in marine mammal surveys in these regions but capturing their demographic composition and habitat use has proven challenging. This study detects sperm whale presence using passive acoustic data from seven sites in the {GOA} and {BSAI} from 2010 to 2019. Differences in click characteristics between males and females (i.e., inter-click and inter-pulse interval) was used as a proxy for animal size/sex to derive time series of animal detections. Generalized additive models with generalized estimation equations demonstrate how spatiotemporal patterns differ between the sexes. Social groups were present at all recording sites with the largest relative proportion at two seamount sites in the {GOA} and an island site in the {BSAI}. We found that the seasonal patterns of presence varied for the sexes and between the sites. Male presence was highest in the summer and lowest in the winter, conversely, social group peak presence was in the winter for the {BSAI} and in the spring for the {GOA} region, with the lowest presence in the summer months. This study demonstrates that social groups are not restricted to lower latitudes and capture their present-day habitat use in the North Pacific. It highlights that sperm whale distribution is more complex than accounted for in management protocol and underscores the need for improved understanding of sperm whale demographic composition to better understand the impacts of increasing anthropogenic threats, particularly climate change.},

Baseline data was collected from 2020 to 2022, with six passive acoustic recorders ({SoundTraps}) deployed at shallow (\&lt;60 m) sites in the vicinity of Nantucket Shoals and Cox’s Ledge. Data were analysed for sperm whale presence, and demographic composition was assessed using interclick intervals. Presence varied by site, season, and year. Sperm whales were detected year-round but the majority (78\%) of days with acoustic occurrences were between May and August. Three demographic classes (putative social groups, adult males, and midsize animals) were detected across multiple seasons, with social groups detected most frequently. Sound propagation tests were conducted at two sites and predicted detection ranges within 20–40 km indicate that sperm whales were likely in proximity to the {WEA}. These results provide a baseline that will be used to assess ongoing sperm whale presence, especially that of social groups which may be more sensitive to disturbance. This study highlights why sperm whales, classed as endangered in {US} waters, should be considered in mitigation plans and permitting efforts for offshore wind energy.},

	abstract = {In sperm whales (Physeter catodon L. 1758) the nose is vastly hypertrophied, accounting for about one-third of the length or weight of an adult male. Norris and Harvey [in Animal Orientation and Navigation, {NASA} {SP}-262 (1972), pp. 397–417] ascribed a sound-generating function to this organ complex. A sound generator weighing upward of 10 tons and with a cross-section of 1 m is expected to generate high-intensity, directional sounds. This prediction from the Norris and Harvey theory is not supported by published data for sperm whale clicks (source levels of 180 {dB} re 1 μPa and little, if any, directionality). Either the theory is not borne out or the data is not representative for the capabilities of the sound-generating mechanism. To increase the amount of relevant data, a five-hydrophone array, suspended from three platforms separated by 1 km and linked by radio, was deployed at the slope of the continental shelf off Andenes, Norway, in the summers of 1997 and 1998. With this system, source levels up to 223 {dB} re 1 μPa {peRMS} were recorded. Also, source level differences of 35 {dB} for the same click at different directions were seen, which are interpreted as evidence for high directionality. This implicates sonar as a possible function of the clicks. Thus, previously published properties of sperm whale clicks underestimate the capabilities of the sound generator and therefore cannot falsify the Norris and Harvey theory.},

	abstract = {Characterizing population structure and dynamics is critical for the conservation of endangered species. Monitoring sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus is especially difficult because it requires monitoring different latitudes to capture the dynamics of most populations. Since their remarkable sexual dimorphism in body size is reflected in their sounds, passive acoustic monitoring presents an opportunity to capture contiguous patterns in time, space, and over large scales. We show that the echolocation repetition rate (measured as inter-click interval, {ICI}) as a proxy for body length is a suitable approach for large-scale acoustic monitoring. Body length has previously been estimated from the time interval between pulses ({IPI}) within sperm whale echolocation clicks. These estimates can only be achieved when whales are oriented toward the recorder or directly facing away, resulting in sparse data. A representative subsample of data demonstrated that {ICI} and {IPI} are linearly correlated, allowing conversion of {ICI} distributions into likely body length categories. This approach was applied to three monitoring sites in the Gulf of Mexico (2010–2017), where sperm whale population structure and male movements were poorly understood. We identified three classes: large animals between 12–15 m ({ICI} between 0.72 and 1 sec), presumed to correspond to adult males, and small animals below 12 m ({ICI} between 0.44 and 0.64 sec) likely pertaining to social groups (mixed groups with adult females and their offspring), and the third class with mid-sized animals ({ICI} between 0.64 and 0.83 sec) believed to contain adult females or sub-adult males. Our results revealed spatial and seasonal variability of the population structure including possible male presence throughout the year and migratory patterns of the population. This approach provides a means to efficiently characterize the putative population structure of sperm whales to understand the population's geographical dynamics and population status, which is relevant under rapidly changing habitat conditions.},

This study investigates using clicks for species and population identification by characterizing the spectral structure of Risso's dolphin echolocation clicks recorded over wide-ranging geographic regions including the U.S. waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and North Pacific Ocean; and international waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. All recordings with Risso's dolphin clicks exhibited the spectral peak and notch pattern described off southern California, indicating the presence of peak banding patterns is useful for species discrimination. Geographic regions were a significant explanatory factor for variability in the frequencies of click spectral peaks, with relatively higher frequency peaks and notches found off Hawaii compared to California waters and off the southeast U.S. compared to the Gulf of Mexico. In the North Atlantic Ocean, a latitudinal cline in frequencies was evident. Potential causes of acoustic variation within and among acoustic encounters are evaluated.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring ({PAM}) has proven a powerful tool for the study of marine mammals, allowing for documentation of biologically relevant factors such as movement patterns or animal behaviors while remaining largely non-invasive and cost effective. From 2008–2019, a set of {PAM} recordings covering the frequency band of most toothed whale (odontocete) echolocation clicks were collected at sites off the islands of Hawaiʻi, Kauaʻi, and Pearl and Hermes Reef. However, due to the size of this dataset and the complexity of species-level acoustic classification, multi-year, multi-species analyses had not yet been completed. This study shows how a machine learning toolkit can effectively mitigate this problem by detecting and classifying echolocation clicks using a combination of unsupervised clustering methods and human-mediated analyses. Using these methods, it was possible to distill ten unique echolocation click ‘types’ attributable to regional odontocetes at the genus or species level. In one case, auxiliary sightings and recordings were used to attribute a new click type to the rough-toothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis. Types defined by clustering were then used as input classes in a neural-network based classifier, which was trained, tested, and evaluated on 5-minute binned data segments. Network precision was variable, with lower precision occurring most notably for false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens, across all sites (35–76\%). However, accuracy and recall were high ({\textgreater}96\% and {\textgreater}75\%, respectively) in all cases except for one type of short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, call class at Kauaʻi and Pearl and Hermes Reef (recall {\textgreater}66\%). These results emphasize the utility of machine learning in analysis of large {PAM} datasets. The classifier and timeseries developed here will facilitate further analyses of spatiotemporal patterns of included toothed whales. Broader application of these methods may improve the efficiency of global multi-species {PAM} data processing for echolocation clicks, which is needed as these datasets continue to grow.},

The {DCS} (1) accounts for persistent narrowband and transient broadband noise, (2) characterizes temporal variation of dominant call frequencies via pitch-tracking, and (3) classifies calls based on attributes of the resulting pitch tracks using quadratic discriminant function analysis ({QDFA}). Automated detections of sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) downsweep calls and North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) upcalls were evaluated using recordings collected in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2006 and 2007. The accuracy of the {DCS} was similar to that of a human analyst: variability in differences between the {DCS} and an analyst was similar to that between independent analysts, and temporal variability in call rates was similar among the {DCS} and several analysts.},

Previously-described click types for eight known odontocete species or genera were identified in this data set: Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris), Cuvier’s beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris), Gervais’ beaked whales (Mesoplodon europaeus), Sowerby’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon bidens), and True’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon mirus), Kogia spp., Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus), and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). Six novel delphinid echolocation click types were identified and named according to their median peak frequencies. Consideration of the spatiotemporal distribution of these unidentified click types, and comparison to historical sighting data, enabled assignment of the probable species identity to three of the six types, and group identity to a fourth type. {UD}36, {UD}26, and {UD}28 were attributed to Risso’s dolphin (G. griseus), short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus), and short-beaked common dolphin (D. delphis), respectively, based on similar regional distributions and seasonal presence patterns. {UD}19 was attributed to one or more species in the subfamily Globicephalinae based on spectral content and signal timing. {UD}47 and {UD}38 represent distinct types for which no clear spatiotemporal match was apparent. This approach leveraged the power of big acoustic and big visual data to add to the catalog of known species-specific acoustic signals and yield new inferences about odontocete spatiotemporal distribution patterns.

An optimal feature set for discriminating the three click types while also separating detected clicks from unidentified delphinids was determined using supervised step-wise discriminant analysis. Linear and quadratic discriminant analyses both achieved error rates below 1\% with three features, determined by tenfold cross validation. The waveform fractal dimension was found to be a highly ranked feature among standard spectral and temporal parameters. The top-ranking features were Higuchi's fractal dimension, spectral centroid, Katz's fractal dimension, and −10 {dB} duration. Six clustering routines, including four popular network-based algorithms, were also evaluated as unsupervised classification methods using the selected feature set. False positive rates of 0.001 and 0.024 were achieved by Chinese Whispers and spectral clustering, respectively, across 200 randomized trials. However, Chinese Whispers clustering yielded larger false negative rates.

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring ({PAM}), particularly autonomous platforms, offers many advantages in monitoring phonating deep-diving marine mammals in oceanic environment. Relevant data can be obtained day and night continuously over long durations and in any weather conditions. It provides a cost-efficient solution with greater detection ranges when compared to traditional large research vessel and aerial visual surveys requiring keeping expert observers on station for long periods of time and relying on good visibility and calm seas. Therefore, {PAM} is becoming a preferred tool to assess population dynamics trends and health of deep-water marine mammal stocks. However the large volumes of collected data require robust automatic detection and classification algorithms to identify marine mammals in recordings. As for beaked whales, one of the challenging automatic processing goals is the identification of different species to advance our understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem. At present, traditional detection and classification methods employ searches for acoustic events above a user-defined signal-to-noise ratio threshold in the frequency band of interest and further rely on an experienced operator's manual inspection for species classification and removal of false positives. Current passive monitoring data collection systems yield large volumes of acoustic data, therefore a manual classification approach becomes very time-consuming and impractical. This paper focuses on developing a multi-stage automatic classifier for beaked whale species. The proposed method utilizes unsupervised machine clustering of signal attributes extracted from potential detection events flagged by an energy-band detector. The proposed algorithm was benchmarked against a manually annotated workshop dataset and applied to acoustic data collected in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The algorithm classifies beaked whale species in automatic mode with minimal operator involvement only at the validation stage. When compared with the manually annotated classification dataset, the proposed method achieved a recall rate of 82.8\% for Cuvier's and 77.9\% for Gervais' species in automatic mode. New insights on habitat use by different species of beaked whales in the Gulf of Mexico were gained when using the species-specific classifier. The high spatial resolution acoustic monitoring results showed that the habitat preferences of two dominating beaked whale species in the Gulf of Mexico support the habitat division (ecological niche) hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on {GANs} are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

The specific animal audio classification problems are i) birds and ii) cat sounds, whose datasets are freely available. We train five different {CNNs} on the original datasets and on their versions augmented by four augmentation protocols, working on the raw audio signals or their representations as spectrograms. We compared our best approaches with the state of the art, showing that we obtain the best recognition rate on the same datasets, without ad hoc parameter optimization. Our study shows that different {CNNs} can be trained for the purpose of animal audio classification and that their fusion works better than the stand-alone classifiers.

While Ketos provides a high-level programming interface for training deep neural networks at detecting and classifying sounds, {MAIPL} is a modular cloud computing service that supports the full model-development workflow. In this contribution, an overview of Ketos and {MAIPL} will be given and their functionalities will be demonstrated through their application to the {HALLO} (Humans and {ALgorithms} Listening for Orcas) project.

Lack of ecological knowledge limits the understanding of, and ability to manage, potential threats impeding recovery of this declining population. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, in partnership with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, initiated a passive acoustics monitoring program in 2017 to investigate beluga seasonal occurrence by deploying a series of passive acoustic moorings. Data have been processed with semi-automated tonal detectors followed by time intensive manual validation. To reduce this labor intensive and time-consuming process, in addition to increasing the accuracy of classification results, the authors constructed an ensembled deep learning convolutional neural network model to classify beluga detections as true or false. Using a 0.5 threshold, the final model achieves 96.57\% precision and 92.26\% recall on testing dataset. This methodology proves to be successful at classifying beluga signals, and the framework can be easily generalized to other acoustic classification problems.},

	abstract = {Delphinids produce large numbers of short duration, broadband echolocation clicks which may be useful for species classification in passive acoustic monitoring efforts. A challenge in echolocation click classification is to overcome the many sources of variability to recognize underlying patterns across many detections. An automated unsupervised network-based classification method was developed to simulate the approach a human analyst uses when categorizing click types: Clusters of similar clicks were identified by incorporating multiple click characteristics (spectral shape and inter-click interval distributions) to distinguish within-type from between-type variation, and identify distinct, persistent click types. Once click types were established, an algorithm for classifying novel detections using existing clusters was tested. The automated classification method was applied to a dataset of 52 million clicks detected across five monitoring sites over two years in the Gulf of Mexico ({GOM}). Seven distinct click types were identified, one of which is known to be associated with an acoustically identifiable delphinid (Risso’s dolphin) and six of which are not yet identified. All types occurred at multiple monitoring locations, but the relative occurrence of types varied, particularly between continental shelf and slope locations. Automatically-identified click types from autonomous seafloor recorders without verifiable species identification were compared with clicks detected on sea-surface towed hydrophone arrays in the presence of visually identified delphinid species. These comparisons suggest potential species identities for the animals producing some echolocation click types. The network-based classification method presented here is effective for rapid, unsupervised delphinid click classification across large datasets in which the click types may not be known a priori.},

They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal processing and analysis an important component. Computational bioacoustics has accelerated in recent decades due to the growth of affordable digital sound recording devices, and to huge progress in informatics such as big data, signal processing and machine learning. Methods are inherited from the wider field of deep learning, including speech and image processing. However, the tasks, demands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in speech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which evidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In this paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for computational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and analyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the community should aim to address, in order to make the most of future developments in {AI} and informatics, and to use audio data in answering zoological and ecological questions.},

	abstract = {Acoustic recorders are commonly used to remotely monitor and collect data on bats (Order Chiroptera). These efforts result in many acoustic recordings that must be classified by a bat biologist with expertise in call classification in order to obtain useful information. The rarity of this expertise and time constraints have prompted efforts to automatically classify bat species in acoustic recordings using a variety of learning methods. There are several software programs available for this purpose, but they are imperfect and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service often recommends that a qualified acoustic analyst review bat call identifications even if using these software programs. We sought to build a model to classify bat species using modern computer vision techniques. We used images of bat echolocation calls (i.e., plots of the pulses) to train deep learning computer vision models that automatically classify bat calls to species. Our model classifies 10 species, five of which are protected under the Endangered Species Act. We evaluated our models using standard model validation procedures, and performed two external tests. For these tests, an entire dataset was withheld from the procedure before splitting the data into training and validation sets. We found that our validation accuracy (92\%) and testing accuracy (90\%) were higher than when we used Kaleidoscope Pro and {BCID} software (65\% and 61\% accuracy, respectively) to evaluate the same calls. Our results suggest that our approach is effective at classifying bat species from acoustic recordings, and our trained model will be incorporated into new bat call identification software: {WEST}-{EchoVision}.},

For the purpose of detection, acoustic signals are converted to images using a Fourier transform operation. Therefore, acoustic pulses become specific shapes. The detection of pulses and their seasonal distribution is used by biologists to estimate the presence of animals and understand their behavior, and they have important ecological value. However, the variations in shape and the presence of background noise make detection difficult. The use of automated instruments for this task is crucial to processing the huge amount of data that comes from hundreds of hours of recordings in a fast and effective way. In this work, different network architectures are compared to assess their effectiveness in the task on a subset of recordings. Additionally, these are compared with other Machine Learning methods from the literature. The best performing network architecture is then applied to the whole set, consisting of three months of recordings, showing an accuracy of 81.37\% and a precision of 75\%, comparable to the results obtained with other methods.},

	abstract = {Progress in deep learning, more specifically in using convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) for the creation of classification models, has been tremendous in recent years. Within bioacoustics research, there has been a large number of recent studies that use {CNNs}. Designing {CNN} architectures from scratch is non-trivial and requires knowledge of machine learning. Furthermore, hyper-parameter tuning associated with {CNNs} is extremely time consuming and requires expensive hardware. In this paper we assess whether it is possible to build good bioacoustic classifiers by adapting and re-using existing {CNNs} pre-trained on the {ImageNet} dataset – instead of designing them from scratch, a strategy known as transfer learning that has proved highly successful in other domains. This study is a first attempt to conduct a large-scale investigation on how transfer learning can be used for passive acoustic monitoring ({PAM}), to simplify the implementation of {CNNs} and the design decisions when creating them, and to remove time consuming hyper-parameter tuning phases. We compare 12 modern {CNN} architectures across 4 passive acoustic datasets that target calls of the Hainan gibbon Nomascus hainanus, the critically endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata, the vulnerable Thyolo alethe Chamaetylas choloensis, and the Pin-tailed whydah Vidua macroura. We focus our work on data scarcity issues by training {PAM} binary classification models very small datasets, with as few as 25 verified examples. Our findings reveal that transfer learning can result in up to 82\% F1 score while keeping {CNN} implementation details to a minimum, thus rendering this approach accessible, easier to design, and speeding up further vocalisation annotations to create {PAM} robust models.},

	abstract = {Owing to major technological advances, bioacoustics has become a burgeoning field in ecological research worldwide. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders are becoming widely used to monitor aerial insectivorous bats, and automatic classifiers have emerged to aid researchers in the daunting task of analysing the resulting massive acoustic datasets. However, the scarcity of comprehensive reference call libraries still hampers their wider application in highly diverse tropical assemblages. Capitalizing on a unique acoustic dataset of {\textgreater}650,000 bat call sequences collected over a 3-year period in the Brazilian Amazon, the aims of this study were (a) to assess how pre-identified recordings of free-flying and hand-released bats could be used to train an automatic classification algorithm (random forest), and (b) to optimize acoustic analysis protocols by combining automatic classification with visual post-validation, whereby we evaluated the proportion of sound files to be post-validated for different thresholds of classification accuracy. Classifiers were trained at species or sonotype (group of species with similar calls) level. Random forest models confirmed the reliability of using calls of both free-flying and hand-released bats to train custom-built automatic classifiers. To achieve a general classification accuracy of {\textasciitilde}85\%, random forest had to be trained with at least 500 pulses per species/sonotype. For seven out of 20 sonotypes, the most abundant in our dataset, we obtained high classification accuracy ({\textgreater}90\%). Adopting a desired accuracy probability threshold of 95\% for the random forest classifier, we found that the percentage of sound files required for manual post-validation could be reduced by up to 75\%, a significant saving in terms of workload. Combining automatic classification with manual {ID} through fully customizable classifiers implemented in open-source software as demonstrated here shows great potential to help overcome the acknowledged risks and biases associated with the sole reliance on automatic classification.},

Automated signal recognition software reduces the expert time needed for recording analyses and allows researchers and managers to manage large acoustic datasets. The application of state-of-the-art techniques for automated identification, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, may be challenging for ecologists and managers without informatics or engineering expertise. Here, we evaluated the use of {AudioMoth} — a low-cost and open-source sound recorder — to monitor a threatened and patchily distributed species, the Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris). Passive acoustic monitoring was carried out across 17 potential wetlands in north Spain. We also assessed the performance of {BirdNET} — an automated and freely available classifier able to identify over 3000 bird species — and Kaleidoscope Pro — a user-friendly recognition software — to detect the vocalizations and the presence of the target species. The percentage of presences and vocalizations of the Eurasian bittern automatically detected by {BirdNET} and Kaleidoscope Pro software was compared to manual annotations of 205 recordings. The species was effectively recorded up to distances of 801–900 m, with at least 50\% of the vocalizations uttered within that distance being manually detected; this distance was reduced to 601–700 m when considering the analyses carried out using Kaleidoscope Pro. {BirdNET} detected the species in 59 of the 63 (93.7\%) recordings with known presence of the species, while Kaleidoscope detected the bittern in 62 recordings (98.4\%). At the vocalization level, {BirdNet} and Kaleidoscope Pro were able to detect between 76 and 78\%, respectively, of the vocalizations detected by a human observer. Our study highlights the ability of {AudioMoth} for detecting the bittern at large distances, which increases the potential of that technique for monitoring the species at large spatial scales. According to our results, a single {AudioMoth} could be useful for monitoring the species' presence in wetlands of up to 150 ha. Our study proves the utility of passive acoustic monitoring, coupled with {BirdNET} or Kaleidoscope Pro, as an accurate, repeatable, and cost-efficient method for monitoring the Eurasian bittern at large spatial and temporal scales. Nonetheless, further research should evaluate the performance of {BirdNET} on a larger number of species, and under different recording conditions (e.g., more closed habitats), to improve our knowledge about {BirdNET}'s ability to perform bird monitoring. Future studies should also aim to develop an adequate protocol to perform effective passive acoustic monitoring of the Eurasian bittern.},

	abstract = {Bioacoustic assessments of species richness are rapidly becoming attainable, but uncertainty regarding the optimal acoustic survey design remains. Selecting the duration of recording and the number of recording units are critical decisions, and we used both simulated and empirical data to quantify the trade-offs those choices present. We evaluated the performance of 30 hypothetical acoustic survey designs (e.g. continuous recording, every other 5 min, etc.). Simulated bird species' (n ≤ 60) abundance across the study area, probability of daily availability and time-dependent probability of vocal activity varied randomly within ranges of realistic values. Field data, collected in central New York, {USA} (747 hr) and in the northern Sierra Nevada, {USA} (1,090 hr), was analysed with a novel machine-learning algorithm, {BirdNET}. All three datasets were subsampled at 5-min intervals, observed species richness was compared across survey designs, and detection probability was calculated for each species. Observed species richness increased with survey coverage (number of recording units) and with recording duration in all three datasets. The impact of differences in survey coverage decreased as recording duration decreased. Species' detection probabilities were negatively affected by reducing the number of days of recording and by reducing the daily recording duration. The more rare species a community had, the more species richness was underestimated as survey coverage decreased. Rarefaction curves indicated that increasing recording time has diminishing marginal utility but that the asymptote varies among communities. The cost per species observed decreased with increasing recording duration. Discontinuous and reduced-coverage sampling may still yield fairly accurate assessments of biodiversity but reducing recording duration or coverage will result in different species remaining undetected. Whether the performance of a study design is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ depends on researchers' constraints and scientific questions to be answered. More hardware and longer recording durations are not always better, but we caution researchers against doing the bare minimum required for their present needs without pressing financial reasons to do so.},

	abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks ({DNNs}) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a {DNN}, called {BirdNET}, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks ({ResNets}), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four {eBird} hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short {FFT} window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, {BirdNET} achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, {BirdNET} and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.},

	abstract = {In a rapidly changing world, where species conservation needs vary by local habitat, concentrated conservation efforts at small spatial scales can be critical. Bats provide an array of value to the ecosystems they inhabit; many bat species are also of conservation concern. San Diego County, California, contains 22 of the 41 bat species that occur in the United States, 16 of which are on conservation watchlists. Thus, management of bat communities in San Diego County is a pressing need. Because bats exploit vast areas of the landscape and historical sampling strategies have shifted over time, a standardized way of prioritizing areas of the landscape for management would provide an integral asset to bat conservation. We leveraged long-term bat community survey data from sampling areas across San Diego County to prioritize areas with the most management need. We calculated two types of scores: species scores and threat scores. Species scores incorporated richness and conservation status, and threat scores included landscape level threats that bats could encounter. We found that urbanization, the presence of artificial lights, and areas sampled on unconserved land were all significantly associated with decreases in species richness. Further, using species and threat scores, each sampling area was placed into one of four conservation categories, in order from greatest to least conservation need, ranging from highest priority (high species score, high threat score) to lowest (low species score, low threat score). Additionally, we focused on sampling areas in which Townsend’s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii) and/or pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) occurred. These two species are of exceptional conservation concern in San Diego County and across the western United States. We identified urbanization, the presence of artificial lights, and areas sampled on unconserved land as threats that were all significantly associated with the absence of Townsend’s big-eared bat, but not pallid bat. The strategy, methodology, and solutions proposed in our study should assist bat conservation and management efforts wherever bats occur, and can be extended to other species that require conservation attention.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in low-cost autonomous recording unit ({ARU}) technology have made large-scale bat monitoring projects more practical, but several key features of {ARUs} (e.g., microphone quality and triggering thresholds) can influence their ability to detect and record bats. As such, it is important to quantify and report variation in {ARU} performance as new recording systems become available. We used the automated classification software {SonoBat} to compare the numbers of call files, echolocation pulses, and species recorded by a commonly used, full-spectrum bat detector—the Song Meter {SM}4BAT-{FS}—and a less expensive, open-source {ARU} that can detect ultrasound—the {AudioMoth}. We deployed paired {ARUs} across several forest types in Louisiana during breeding (June–August) and nonbreeding (December–February) periods in 2020 and 2021. Weatherproof cases were unavailable for {AudioMoths} at the time of our study. Thus, we used disposable plastic bags and plastic boxes recommended by the manufacturer and other {AudioMoth} users to house our monitors. We lost several {AudioMoths} to water damage using both methods and subsequently placed these monitors in waterproof smartphone bags for the remainder of our study. We compared data collected by {AudioMoths} in the three enclosures and found no differences in the number of call files identified to species or species richness. We found that {SM}4BATs recorded more call files identifiable to species, more call files with high-frequency bat calls, more echolocation pulses, and higher species richness than {AudioMoths}. Our results likely reflect differences in microphone sensitivities, recording specifications, and enclosures between the {ARUs}. We recommend caution when comparing data collected by different {ARUs}, especially over time as firmware updates and new enclosures become available, and additional research is needed to examine variation in monitor performance across a wide range of environmental conditions.},

We developed a framework for monitoring and assessment of endangered light-footed Ridgway’s rails (Rallus obsoletus levipes) across their U.S. range, relative to multi-scale recovery goals. We created spatially explicit sample units and a sampling frame covering all potential habitat to facilitate range-wide probability sampling, and also built a model of the call-broadcast process commonly used to survey marsh birds that included heterogeneity in availability for detection and conditional detectability for each bird during each survey. We used the model to simulate 96 sampling strategies that included different levels of replication, multiple approaches for sample allocation amongst strata, and both simple random and weighted probability sampling (i.e., weights proportional to local rail abundance) of sample units within strata. Effective monitoring surveyed ≥ 20–30\% of the sampling frame on ≥ 3 occasions, with weighted sample selection and more targeted sampling (50\% of units) for strata that are key to species recovery. We also tested Bayesian N-mixture models for estimating abundance and show that multiple models provide reasonable estimates. This work lays the foundation for statistical sampling and multi-scale population estimation for an endangered bird, and for refinement of abundance estimation models. Moreover, this work provides a replicable process for building customized and statistically defensible sampling frameworks to assess recovery of endangered species that can be used for other sensitive species.},

	abstract = {Many species of marsh birds (e.g. rails and bitterns) are believed to be declining in North America, yet we lack an effective monitoring program to estimate their population trends. Broadcast of prerecorded calls to elicit vocalizations is a commonly used method in surveys of marsh birds, but whether gains in detection and index precision outweigh the drawbacks of call-broadcast is unclear. To evaluate the effectiveness of call-broadcast surveys, we pooled marsh-bird survey data from 8,047 point-count surveys contributed by 11 cooperators and compared numbers of birds detected and variation in numbers detected between call-broadcast and passive surveys. For most rails (particularly Virginia Rails [Rallus limicola]), call-broadcast surveys were effective at increasing the detection probability (e.g. average number of Virginia Rails detected per occupied point was 1.25 for call-broadcast surveys and 0.17 for passive surveys). The proportion of points at which no birds were detected was high for all species (range 74–99\%) and was slightly lower on call-broadcast surveys as compared with passive surveys. Coefficient of variation ({CV}) among replicate surveys was higher for passive surveys, particularly for rails (average {CV} in number of birds detected per point was 209\% for passive surveys and 189\% for call-broadcast surveys). On the basis of those results, we recommend a marsh-bird monitoring protocol that includes an initial passive period followed by a period of call-broadcast to provide survey data that incorporate the benefits while avoiding the drawbacks of call-broadcast. We also recommend separating both the passive and the call-broadcast periods into 1-min subsegments that will allow estimates of components of detection probability within the monitoring effort.Efectividad de Censos que Reproducen Vocalizaciones Pregrabadas para Monitorear Aves de Pantano},

As part of that effort, a standardized survey protocol was developed in 1999 that provided guidance for conducting marsh bird surveys throughout North America such that data would be consistent among locations. The original survey protocol has been revised to provide greater clarification on many issues as the number of individuals using the protocol has grown. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol instructs surveyors to conduct an initial 5-minute passive point-count survey followed by a series of 1-minute segments during which marsh bird calls are broadcast into the marsh following a standardized approach. Surveyors are instructed to record each individual bird from the suite of 26 focal species that are present in their local area on separate lines of a datasheet and estimate the distance to each bird. Also, surveyors are required to record whether each individual bird was detected within each 1-minute subsegment of the survey. These data allow analysts to use several different approaches for estimating detection probability. The Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol provides detailed instructions that explain the field methods used to monitor marsh birds in North America.},

Occupancy probability for both species combined was 0.64 (95\% {CI}: 0.53, 0.75) in marshes along the Pamunkey and 0.59 (0.45, 0.72) in marshes along the Mattaponi. Occupancy probability along the Pamunkey was strongly influenced by salinity, increasing logistically by a factor of 1.62 (0.6, 2.65) per parts per thousand of salinity. In contrast, there was not a strong salinity gradient on the Mattaponi and therefore vegetative community structure determined occupancy probability on that river. Estimated detection probability across both marshes was 0.63 (0.62, 0.65), but detection rates decreased as the season progressed. Monitoring wildlife within wetlands presents unique challenges for conservation managers. Our findings provide insight not only into how rails responded to environmental variation but also into the general utility of {ARUs} for occupancy modeling of the distribution and habitat associations of rails within tidal marsh systems.},

	abstract = {Effective monitoring of rare and declining species is critical to enable their conservation, but can often be difficult due to detectability or survey constraints. However, developments in acoustic recorders are enabling an important new approach for improved monitoring that is especially applicable for long-term studies, and for use in difficult environments or with cryptic species. Bioacoustic data may be effectively analysed within an occupancy modelling framework, as presence/absence can be determined, and repeated survey events can be accommodated. Hence, both occupancy and detectability estimates can be produced from large, coherent datasets. However, the most effective methods for the practical detection and identification of call data are still far from established. We assessed a novel combination of automated clustering and manual verification to detect and identify heathland bird vocalizations, covering a period of six days at 44 sampling locations. Occupancy (Ψ) and detectability (p) were modelled for each species, and the best fit models provided values of: nightjar Ψ = 0.684, p = 0.740, Dartford warbler Ψ = 0.449, p = 0.196 and woodlark Ψ = 0.13, p = 0.996. Including environmental covariates within the occupancy models indicated that tree, wetland and heather cover were important variables, particularly influencing detectability. The protocol used here allowed robust and consistent survey data to be gathered, with limited fieldwork resourcing, allowing population estimates to be generated for the target bird species. The combination of bioacoustics and occupancy modelling can provide a valuable new monitoring approach, allowing population trends to be identified, and the effects of environmental change and site management to be assessed.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is a common method of studying bats that involves recording echolocation calls of bats in their natural environment. Call sequences are then identified to species using automated acoustic analysis software. One limitation of acoustic software programs, particularly for long-term monitoring efforts, is that newer versions may provide results that are not directly comparable with older versions. However, there is little available information regarding how much or in what ways the versions differ, or which versions are most accurate. We evaluated 2 software programs used for automated bat call identification by testing a common set of echolocation call files across multiple versions of each program. We quantified the level of agreement on identification results and compared accuracy rates among the versions of each program. Level of agreement varied by species, recording location, and the software versions being compared. Overall percent agreement ranged from 28–82\%. Newer versions were more conservative, in that they assigned fewer species-level identifications. However, newer versions were not substantially more accurate than older versions. Our conclusions suggest that bat researchers should be attentive to what software versions and settings are used as they plan and perform data analyses. Software developers could assist software users by providing more detailed information about their testing procedures and results, and what changes are associated with new versions. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.},

However, conservation projects need reliable population data to understand the species status and prioritise strategies. We acoustically monitored the corncrake (Crex crex), a nationally endangered ground-nesting bird in Ireland. Little is known about the calling pattern of this species, and consequently, survey efforts may not be efficiently allocated. Twelve long-term acoustic deployments were manually scanned to extract the male broadcast calls. The calling activity was modelled as a response variable predicted by weather, lunar and temporal variables. Additionally, detectability according to weather variables and lunar fraction was assessed using a single-species occupancy model. We found marked vocal diel (hour, P {\textless} 0.001) and seasonal (date, P {\textless} 0.001) patterns. The calling activity was also negatively affected by temperature (P {\textless} 0.001) and wind speed (P {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, a significant interaction (P = 0.023) existed between cloud cover and lunar illumination. The detectability analysis highlighted a 64 \% probability of detecting a corncrake at an occupied site during a night visit. Wind speed and cloud cover negatively affected the likelihood of detection, while lunar fraction had a positive influence. We concluded that corncrake surveys should continue to focus the effort between 23:00 and 03:00, considering that calling peak activity occurred between 01:00–02:00 in May and June. Cool nights with clear sky, high lunar illumination and wind speed below 20 km/h are recommended to improve detections. By planning surveys on these conditions, conservation projects may enhance species detection and save resources required for field efforts.},

However, there is little information on how {ARUs} compare to human surveyors or how best to use {ARU} data that can be collected continuously throughout the day. We used {ARUs} to conduct 2 acoustic surveys for king (Rallus elegans) and clapper rails (R. crepitans) within a tidal marsh complex along the Pamunkey River, Virginia, {USA}, during May–July 2015. To determine the effectiveness of an {ARU} in replacing human personnel, we compared results of callback point-count surveys with concurrent acoustic recordings and calculated estimates of detection probability for both rail species combined. The success of {ARUs} at detecting rails that human observers recorded decreased with distance (P ≤ 0.001), such that at {\textless}25 m, 90.3\% of human-recorded rails also were detected by the {ARU}, but at {\textgreater}75 m, only 34.0\% of human-detected rails were detected by the {ARU}. To determine a subsampling scheme for continuous {ARU} data that allows for effective surveying of presence and call rates of rails, we used {ARUs} to conduct 15 continuous 48-hr passive surveys, generating 720 hr of recordings. We established 5 subsampling periods of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min to evaluate {ARU}-based presence and vocalization detections of rails compared with each of the full 60-min sampling of {ARU}-based detection of rails. All subsampling periods resulted in different (P ≤ 0.001) detection rates and unstandardized vocalization rates compared with the hourly sampling period. However, standardized vocalization counts from the 30-min subsampling period were not different from vocalization counts of the full hourly sampling period. When surveying rail species in estuarine environments, species-, habitat-, and {ARU}-specific limitations to {ARU} sampling should be considered when making inferences about abundances and distributions from {ARU} data. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is a non-invasive tool for automated wildlife monitoring. This technique has several advantages and addresses many of the biases related to traditional field surveys. However, locating animal sounds using autonomous recording units ({ARUs}) can be technically challenging and therefore {ARUs} have traditionally been little employed to estimate animal density. Nonetheless, several approaches have been proposed in recent years to carry out acoustic-based bird density estimations. We conducted a literature review of studies that used {ARUs} for estimating bird densities or bird abundances in order to describe the applications and improve future monitoring programmes. We detected a growing interest in the use of {ARUs} for estimating bird density in the last 6 years (2014–19), with a total of 31 articles assessing the topic. The most common approach was to estimate the relationship between the number of vocalizations per recording time with bird density or bird abundance estimated in the field (61\%). In 26 studies (79\%), bird estimates obtained by human surveyors agreed with those obtained using {ARUs}. Some approaches have proven able to reduce biases in acoustic surveys, such as considering imperfect detection (spatially explicit capture–recapture, using microphone arrays), applying paired acoustic sampling to control for different sampling radius between humans and {ARUs}, or including relative sound level measurements that allow researchers to estimate bird distance to recorder. However, several studies did not include any covariates to reduce existing biases and some did not estimate the sampling radius of the recorder, which may hamper future comparisons between human and {ARU} surveys. Future studies should include a measurement of the sampling radius of the recorder employed to be able to obtain density estimations using {ARUs}. Finally, we provide some guidelines to improve the applicability of {ARUs} to infer bird population estimates in future studies.},

Two populations existing in the Gulf of California have been proposed, but difficulties in obtaining biopsies have complicated testing the hypothesis of discrete stock difference between north and south of the Gulf. On the other hand, bioacoustics analyses have been used to differentiate populations from other whale species. Therefore, to provide information for the previously proposed hypothesis, the most common Bryde’s call (Be4) in the region was analyzed. Acoustic data was collected using a High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package ({HARP}) system placed at two locations in the Gulf of California: one in the north from November 2006 to June 2007 and other one in the south from August to December 2008. Duration and frequency range were measured for calls with a signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) greater than 27 {dB}. The Mann-Whitney-U test was performed to compare distributions in both geographic areas, and the results were compared with a photo-identification analysis. Of the 903 Be4 calls detected, 103 (north) and 92 (south) met the {SNR} requirement. Duration showed a significant difference (Mann-Whitney test, U = 11238, z-statistics = 2.91, p = 0.003) with southern calls being longer than the nothern ones. The results suggest that the northern population remains resident in the north with some movement towards the south, also verified by photo-identification. A detailed inspection showed a double distribution in the south (Mann-Whitney test, U = 2211, z-statistics = -8.39, p = 4.4776e-17), suggesting the presence at the same time of resident and transient populations. The latter has been suggested to belong to the Eastern Tropical Pacific. The results suggest a geographic variation in B. edeni Be4 call type and support the existence of two populations within the Gulf of California.},

	abstract = {In 2014, a novel call was discovered in autonomous acoustic recordings from the Mariana Archipelago and designated a “Biotwang”. It was assumed to be produced by a baleen whale, but without visual verification it was impossible to assign a species. Using a combination of visual and acoustic survey data collected in the Mariana Archipelago, we determined that Biotwangs are produced by Bryde’s whales. Bryde’s whales occur worldwide in tropical and warm temperate waters, but their population structure and movements are not well understood. Genetic and morphological data recognize two populations in the western North Pacific ({WNP}), separate from those elsewhere in the Pacific. We used a combination of manual and machine learning annotation methods to detect Biotwangs in our extensive historical passive acoustic monitoring datasets collected across the central and western North Pacific. We identified a consistent seasonal presence of Biotwangs in the Mariana Archipelago and to the east at Wake Island, with occasional occurrence as far away as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and near the equator (Howland Island). The seasonal occurrence of Biotwangs is consistent with Bryde’s whales migrating between low and mid-latitudes, with a small peak in calling between February and April and a larger peak between August and November as the whales travel past the recording sites. Our results provide evidence for a pelagic {WNP} population of Bryde’s whales with broad distribution, but with seasonal and inter-annual variation in occurrence that imply a complex range most likely linked to changing oceanographic conditions in this region.},

Based on time of year, spatiotemporal patterns, clear division among calls (i.e., no chorusing), comparisons with known vocalizations of whales, turtles, and fish, and presence of Bryde's whale calls, and because the call has not been detected elsewhere, we hypothesize this 500-Hz pulsed call is produced by Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera brydei).},

	abstract = {The recently named Rice's whale in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most endangered whales in the world, and improved knowledge of spatiotemporal occurrence patterns is needed to support their recovery and conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring methods for determining spatiotemporal occurrence patterns require identifying the species' call repertoire. Rice's whale call repertoire remains unvalidated though several potential call types have been identified. This study uses sonobuoys and passive acoustic tagging to validate the source of potential call types and to characterize Rice's whale calls. During concurrent visual and acoustic surveys, acoustic-directed approaches were conducted to obtain visual verifications of sources of localized sounds. Of 28 acoustic-directed approaches, 79\% led to sightings of balaenopterid whales, of which 10 could be positively identified to species as Rice's whales. Long-moan calls, downsweep sequences, and tonal-sequences are attributed to Rice's whales based on these matches, while anthropogenic sources are ruled out. A potential new call type, the low-frequency downsweep sequence, is characterized from tagged Rice's whale recordings. The validation and characterization of the Rice's whale call repertoire provides foundational information needed to use passive acoustic monitoring for better understanding and conservation of these critically endangered whales.},

	abstract = {An Increase in the study of cetaceans' sounds has motivated the development of different automated sound detection and classification techniques. Passive acoustic monitoring ({PAM}) is extensively used to study these cetaceans' sounds over a period to understand their daily activities within their ecosystem. Using {PAM}, the gathered sound datasets are usually large and impractical to manually analyse and detect. Thus, hidden Markov models ({HMM}) is one of the popular tools used to automatically detect and classify these cetaceans' sounds. Nonetheless, {HMM} rely heavily on the employed feature extraction method such as Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients ({MFCC}) and linear predictive coding ({LPC}). In most cases, the more reliable the extracted feature vector from the known sound label, the higher the sensitivity of the {HMM}. Although these aforementioned feature extraction methods are widely used, their design is based on filters and requires windowing, fast Fourier transforms ({FFT}), and logarithm operations. Consequently, this increases the computational time complexity of the {HMM}. Here, we describe a selective time domain feature extraction method that can be easily adapted with the {HMM}. This proposed feature extraction method uses a combination of some simple but robust parameters such as the mean, relative amplitude and relative power/energy ({MAP}), which are selected based on empirical observations of the call to be detected. The performance of this proposed {MAP}-{HMM} was verified using the acoustic dataset of continuous recordings of an inshore Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera) short pulse calls collected in a single site in False bay, South-West of South Africa. Aside from exhibiting a low computational complexity, the proposed {MAP}-{HMM} offers superior sensitivity and false discovery rate performances in comparison to the {LPC}-{HMM} and {MFCC}-{HMM}.},

	abstract = {A unique acoustic call was identified and attributed to the Bryde's whale in the central North Pacific in 2015, but little is known about the distribution, calling behavior, or swimming behavior of Bryde's whales in the region. Acoustic detections attributed to Bryde's whales were used to localize and track individual whales on the U.S. Pacific Missile Range Facility ({PMRF}) in Kaua ' i, Hawai ' i. This study included 150 acoustically derived tracks from recordings spanning the years 2011-2022 with recording effort in nearly every month. Bryde's whale movement was examined relative to calendar year, day of year, hour of day, wind speed, and acoustic calling rate. Hidden Markov models were used to identify two kinematic states (slower, less directional movement and faster, more directional movement). The findings indicate that Bryde's whales were more likely to travel in a faster and more directional state during the daytime than at night and between May and August when compared to other times of year. The along-track acoustic cue rate was examined for 118 tracks, and the findings indicate a possible lengthening of the median inter-call interval over the duration of the study period. These results are an important first step in understanding more about behavior in Bryde's whales, a relatively under-studied species.},
