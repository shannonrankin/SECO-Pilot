    "text": "Analysis Methods\n\nBird Detection and Classification\nBirdnet Analyzer v2.4 was used to batch analyze recordings for each deployment, with detections were saved as csv files and formatted as Raven selection tables. Settings include: Minimum confidence = .25, Sensitivity = 1, Overlap = 0, Merge consecutive detections = 1, Audo speed modification = 1, minimum bandpass = 0 Hz, Maximum bandpass = 15 kHz; species list based on location (33N, -117W) and year-round with minium occurrence probability of 0.03 for a species to be included. Detection data was output to a Raven selection table, and selection tables were combined into a single table for each recording.\nBirdnet provides a confidence score associated with each detection. These scores are not probabilities but do positively relate to predication accuracy (though this relationship varies by species). Manual validation is required to translate these scores to a predication accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote: All results are preliminary, data were not acoustically validated!\n\n\nWhile this data provides sufficient preliminary recordings to allow for testing the accuracy of automated detection and classification models, this was not conducted due to time required to complete this analysis. As time allows, I intend to identify an alternative automated classifier that has a more flexible license (potentially Perch), manually validate calls, and assess the accuracy of this classifier for Ridgway’s Rails and any other target species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary data were analyzed using R programming language and preliminary results are provided to assess the potential use of PAM for studying Ridgway’s Rails. Preliminary data products and R code are made publicly available in this repository.\n\n\nDistance Sampling\nA subset of data from the Detection Range Test at the Living Coast Proving Pens was manually examined to provide a preliminary estimate the detection range of Ridgway’s Rails calls from the semi-captive animals in the proving pens. This sample detection data was analyzed using the distance R package to develop a (preliminary) detection function. This data provides an initial assessment of the detection range to inform future studies.\nAnalysis of the entire dataset to improve the precision and accuracy of the detection function should be considered prior to implementing a proper distance sampling survey.\n\n\nBat Detection and Classification\nBats produce high frequency echolocation for communication, navigation, and foraging. Detection of these sounds requires a high sampling rate, which in turn has high storage requirements. High frequency sampling was conducted at both sites (Tijuana Estuary and the Living Coast Proving Pens), although recordings were shorter in duration.\nHigh-frequency (192 kHz) recordings were analyzed using a trial evaluation of Kaleidoscope Pro software to detect echolocation clicks from bat species using the Western North America catalog. Again, manual analysis to evaluate the classifier performance, and all results are preliminary. To reduce the number of potentially false detections, all potential bat detections were filtered to eliminate detections with less than 10 echolocation clicks, with a high variability in species detections within events, and with species detections with low classification probabilities. While this approach likely reduces the number of false detections and inaccurate classifications, it should be considered preliminary until a thorough manual evaluation of the data can be conducted.",

    "text": "Historical call-response surveys conducted since 1979 have provided a long time-series monitoring of breeding pairs of Ridgeway’s Rails in southern California. This survey design primarily relied on playback of duetting calls to elicit a response from local breeding pairs(Zembal, Hoffman, and Stahl 2024); however, specific field methods varied throughout the field season. Notably, (Thompson et al. 2024) noted that these playback methods work well when used sparingly. A recent statistical examination of call-response survey design recommended repeated sampling to decrease sampling bias(Stevens et al. 2024). While historical call-response surveys have proven to be an effective approach to monitoring Ridgeway’s Rails, recent advances in PAM monitoring using acoustic recorders may provide a more standardized approach to monitoring Ridgeway’s Rails populations that may ultimately lead to more robust estimation of population trends.\n\n\nWhile there is great potential for using passive acoustic monitoring to assess wildlife populations, how this is done will depend on the management needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n#| echo: false\nshapefile.location &lt;- here(\"data\", \"TJR_RB_2010.shx\")\nregion &lt;- make.region(region.name = \"study area\",\n                      shape = shapefile.location)\ndesign &lt;- make.design(region = region, transect.type = \"point\", design = \"random\",\n                      truncation = 200)\npoints &lt;- generate.transects(design)\nprint(points)\n\n\n   Strata study area:\n   ___________________\nDesign:  randomly located transects\nNumber of samplers:  20\nDesign angle:  0\nEdge protocol:  minus\nCovered area:  2352730\nStrata coverage: 25.36%\nStrata area:  9278511\n\n   Study Area Totals:\n   _________________\nNumber of samplers:  20\nCovered area:  2352730\nAverage coverage: 25.36%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity Surface Models (dsm) for distance sampling data provide spatial models constructed from generalized additive models following methods developed by Hedley & Buckland (2004) and Miller et al. (2013).\n\n\n\n\nStudies of species such as Ridgeway’s Rails benefit from the animals’ tendency to respond vocally to nearby calls. Research suggests that repeated sampling will decrease sampling bias(Stevens et al. 2024), but other research suggests that animals may habituate and render these methods futile(Zembal, Hoffman, and Stahl 2024). Call-response studies provide a measure of the number of animals in a region (abundance), but most call-response studies do not consider how variation in their sampling affects their population estimation. For example, is their ability to detect animals dependent on temporal, environmental or geographic variables? Does the call-response increase their risk by alerting predators to their location? Would an increase in sampling (to decrease bias or to improve seasonal sampling) lead to a decrease in the efficacy of sampling?\nWhile Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) also relies on the vocal activity of species to study their populations, it is inherently a non-invasive way to remotely sense species’ presence. It necessarily relies on the vocal behavior of these species, and therefore is more appropriate for species that can be easily detected and identified to species based on sounds that they voluntarily make. Instead of the single (or limited) call-response sampling, PAM recorders can be deployed year-round to monitor seasonal changes in vocal activity, and\n\nBenefits and Limitations of Call-Response and PAM Sampling.

    "text": "To date, population assessment of Ridgway’s Rails has relied on call-response survey methods conducted by an expert ornithologist. While this long time series has been highly effective, recent research suggests that repeated sampling is required to improve the robustness of the results. Unfortunately, there if evidence that this species may habituate to repeated exposure to call-response surveys, which would lead to worsened outcomes.\nDistance sampling methods using visual or passive acoustic detections has proven successful for a wide range of species. Specifically, passive acoustic monitoring using acoustic recording devices placed throughout the habitat may be used as point transect or spatial capture-recapture models to assess population of cryptic species such as Ridgway’s Rails.\n\nDetection Range\nUnderstanding the effective detection range is fundamental to adopting distance sampling methods for population assessment. The Detection Range Test at the Living Coast Proving Pens provided an opportunity to assess the effective detection range using Audiomoth recorders in this environment. In addition to locating a recorder on each of the proving pens (which we will assume is approximately 1 meters distance from known animals), 8 additional recorders were placed at distance from the pens. This data allowed us to identify the distance at which known calls (from either SPP-1N or SPP-3S) could be detected by the Birdnet Analyzer on the Audiomoth recorders.\nThe map below shows the placement of the recorders on and near the pens (Click on the site to obtain the Site Code), and the table to the right shows the distance of each recorder to to the pen at SPP-01N (DD01) and SPP-03S (DD02).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance to Proving Pen Recorders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance to Site\n\n\n\nSite\nDD01\nDD02\n\n\n\n\nDD01\n0.0\n35.6\n\n\nDD02\n35.6\n0.0\n\n\nDD03\n73.2\n37.9\n\n\nDD04\n14.0\n32.9\n\n\nDD05\n33.2\n22.0\n\n\nDD06\n118.1\n87.2\n\n\nDD07\n143.8\n109.6\n\n\nDD08\n112.3\n78.0\n\n\nDD09\n88.0\n58.7\n\n\nDD10\n58.6\n36.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spectrograms on the right show a Ridgway Rail call with color representing the intensity (amplitude) of the call at the DD01 proving pen site (assumed to be at distance 0m from the source), and at a selection of sites with increasing distance from the source.\nAs expected, the calls of the Ridgway’s Rails are loud at the source (DD01, or proving pen SPP-01S), and the intensity of the call decreases with increasing distance, until the call can no longer be detected.\n\n\n\n\nThe time series, below, shows how the number of calls detected on different recorders decreases with distance from the source (DD01).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data was then used to develop a detection function, which provides an estimate of the effective detection range for these calls. This can then be used to inform a survey design of a distance sampling approach to population assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe range at which a call can be detected varies not only on the source amplitude of the call, but also the environment through which the call propagates. While the experiment at the proving pens provides an excellent preliminary estimate of detection range (and a preliminary detection function), the true detection range may vary by habitat, and the proving pens are different than typical habitat for Ridgway’s Rails. Future research should develop a detection function for Ridgway’s Rails in their preferred habitat.",

    "text": "The habitat of the endangered light-footed Ridgway’s rail (Rallus obsoletus levipes) includes wetlands and lagoons in southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. This species is threatened by habitat degradation and loss, pollution, sea level rise, and non-native species.\nHistorical call-response surveys conducted since 1979 have provided a long time-series monitoring of breeding pairs of Ridgway’s Rails in southern California. This survey design primarily relies on playback of duetting calls to elicit a response from local breeding pairs Zembal, Hoffman, and Stahl (2024). A recent statistical examination of call-response survey design recommended repeated sampling to decrease sampling bias (Stevens et al. 2024); however, Zembal, Hoffman, and Stahl (2024) noted that these playback methods work well when used sparingly. While historical call-response surveys have proven to be an effective approach to monitoring Ridgway’s Rails, recent advances in Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) using autonomous acoustic recorders may provide a more standardized approach to monitoring Ridgway’s Rails populations that may ultimately lead to more robust estimation of population trends.\nThis pilot study serves to identify the potential for PAM surveys as an alternative approach to monitoring the populations of Ridgway’s Rails in San Diego County. PAM has the added potential benefit of extending temporal monitoring with minimal interference during the sensitive breeding season, providing additional contextual information (anthropogenic impacts, biodiversity), and allowing for opportunities to study other local species.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Area\nRecorders\nAnalysis Methods\n\nResults\n\nSummary\nPopulation Assessment\nBiodiversity\n\nFuture Research\nRecommendations\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nStevens, Bryan S., Courtney J.

    "text": "Passive acoustic detection as a means of monitoring species requires that (1) the animals produce sounds that you can readily attribute to them and (2) that you have a basic understanding of the variation in both the sounds they produce and the sounds that you detect on your recorder. While their vocal behavior is well described in (cite papers), there is known variation between sites and there is great value in quantifying this variation to inform future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWarning: All results are preliminary, data were not acoustically validated! Need to validate recordings and assess species-specific confidence thresholds for detections\n\n\n\nDaily Variation\nThere was considerable daily variation in detection of calls associated with Ridgway’s Rails at both the Proving Pens and at the Tijuana Estuary. The variation in detection of calls were similar between the recorders at the two different proving pens (not shown here). While this data is limited in scope, we do not see a strong correlation between the two sites in relation to the higher number of hours of detections. This suggests that larger environmental variables (such as moon phase or weather conditions) may not be responsible for this variation, but this may be related to site-specific variables.\nThis data is preliminary and has not been manually reviewed to confirm detections (add missed calls, remove false positives). Future work should include manual review of these data to ensure that calls assigned to Ridgway’s Rails are in fact calls from those species. This review will also provide a means of quantifying the accuracy (correct classification) of these models for future research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiurnal Variation\nThere is significant research suggesting that Ridgway’s Rails call more frequently during the pre-dawn and dusk time periods, and our results agree. Recordings from the Proving Pens also showed calling throughout the day and very little calling at night. Traditional call-response surveys are conducted at dusk (typically) or pre-dawn (rarely) to align with this known increase in calling behavior. Future passive acoustic surveys could limiting recording periods to one hour before/after sunrise and sunset. While this would extend the duration between recorder turnover, it would also limit additional data provided by passive acoustic monitoring that can provide information related to presence of other species, anthropogenic uses of the area, and potentially other acoustic behaviors that may occur at other times of the day.\nAgain, acoustic detections were not manually reviewed, and it is possible that some of these calls are actually other sounds that were attributed to this species.",
